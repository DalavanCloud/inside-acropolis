	<title>Structure of the RES index</title>
	<para>
		The RES index is made up of a series of <firstterm>composite</firstterm>
		entities which are constructed using the data discovered by the
		crawler. Each of the composite entities has an <literal>owl:sameAs</literal>
		relationship with the various source entities used to construct it,
		a portion of whose data is cached in the index.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you dereference the URI for the RES index (currently
		<uri>http://beta.acropolis.org.uk/</uri>, but this will change), the
		result is some metadata about the index, including information about
		how to perform different kinds of query, and some selected sample
		entities.
	</para>
	<para>
		When a query is performed against the index (i.e., by adding some query
		parameters to the URI), the result is a small amount of metadata about
		the query and the results along with a list of these composite entities.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you then dereference one of these entities—<firstterm>drilling down</firstterm>
		into it—the document returned will contain both the composite entity, and
		the cached data about the source entities. If the entity references, or is
		referenced by other entities, the relevant composite entities are also
		included.
	</para>
	<tip>
		An index of the predicates which are used to generate the composite
		entities and cached alongside them can be found at <link xlink:href="#predicate-index">the
		end of the book</link>.
