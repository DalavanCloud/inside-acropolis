	<para>
		The <firstterm>Research &amp; Education Space</firstterm> is a platform that has been built and delivered by the <link xlink:href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</link>. Its aim is to bring as much as possible of the UK’s publicly-held archives, and more besides, to learners and teachers across the UK.
	</para>
	<para>
		Powering the Research &amp; Education Space is <firstterm>Acropolis</firstterm>, a technical stack which collects, indexes and organises rich structured data about those archive collections published as <firstterm>Linked Open Data</firstterm> (LOD) on the Web. The collected data is organised around the people, places, events, concepts and things related to the items in the archive collections—and, if the archive assets themselves are available in digital form, that data includes the information on how to access them, all in a consistent machine-readable form.
	</para>
	<para>
		Building on the Research &amp; Education Space, applications can make use of this index, along with the source data itself, to make those collections accessible and meaningful.
	</para>
	<para>
		This book describes how a collection-holder can publish their data in a form which can be collected and indexed by the platform and used by applications, and how an application developer can make use of the index and interpret the source data in order to present it to end-users in a useful fashion.
