		In this context we mean what is <emphasis>in</emphasis> the data and the associated media, such as text, video or images.

	<para>
		When making data and media available in to education, it is important
		to understand the expectations of the audience in terms of what they
		will see and hear.
	</para>
	<para>
		These guidelines are intended to help product developers think about
		these issues as early in the design and development process as possible.
	</para>
	<para>
		The Research &amp; Education Space platform is funded with public
		money and needs to show that it is serving the public interest and
		behaving responsibly.

			<para>
				The Research &amp; Education Space programme envisages
				that in schools and FE colleges it will be <emphasis>teachers</emphasis> who are
				the primary users of the products built on top of the Resarch
				&amp; Education Space platform, both the index and the
				assets.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Teachers will then judge the suitability of the content for
				particular age ranges and make it available to pupils.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				The pupils and students will therefore be the secondary
				users of any products, accessing a moderated version of the
				whole platform.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Teachers will need to share material with pupils and other
				teachers and this functionality will be vital.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Where possible the metadata will include any guidance as to
				the suitability of the content for particular age groups,
				for example the BBC might include
				<link xlink:href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidance/help/">guidance warning metadata</link>.</para>

		<listitem>
			<para>
				How this will be displayed to teachers is an important
				consideration in the design of products and services.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				However where no such information is available, it needs to
				be clear that this does <emphasise>not</emphasise> mean that
				the material is necessarily suitable for all ages (so perhaps
				a “no age range given” note is appropriate?)
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				The Research &amp; Education Space programme will provide
				teachers with guidelines about the range of material available
				in the platform and hints on how to navigate and mediate
				such a large volume of metadata and media.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Teachers will also form their own view of what material is
				suitable for whom, and their ability to add that information
				to the metadata and share it is important.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Every product or service built on the platform must have a
				means of feeding back any concerns about aspects of the
				assets or the metadata to the provider of the catalogue and
				assets.
