  <title>Find the index entry for an entity given its URI</title>
  <para>
	The <firstterm>URI look-up capability</firstterm> is available when a
	dataset (including the root) has the <literal>void:uriLookupEndpoint</literal>
	property. The value of this property is the URL to which an encoded
	URI to look up should be appended. For example:
  </para>
<programlisting language="turtle"><![CDATA[<http://acropolis.org.uk/>
	void:uriLookupEndpoint <http://acropolis.org.uk/?uri=> .
]]></programlisting>
	<para>
	  Given the above triple found at the root, an application can locate
	  the entry corresponding to a well-known URI by URL-encoding it and
	  appending it to the look-up endpoint. The API will then return either
	  a redirect response, or a 404 (“Not found”):

	<para>
	  In the above example, the redirect is to <uri>http://acropolis.org.uk/427cf01d1215477489dee6091de16e65#id</uri>, which the application can then
	  dereference.
	</para>
	<note>
	  <para>
		Where the <literal>void:uriLookupEndpoint</literal> property appears
		on a dataset which is not the root, it describes an endpoint which
		provides a look-up capability scoped to the current dataset or results.
		It is at the option of the application developer whether this
		capability is exposed to users, or if only a global look-up option
		is provided where both are available.
