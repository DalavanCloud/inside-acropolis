	<title>An introduction to the Research &amp; Education Space API</title>

	<tip>
		Because the API is read-only and presented to applications as
		<link xlink:href="#lod">Linked Open Data</link> available
		through <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">HTTP Content Negotiation</link>,
		there are no API keys or other authentication mechanisms: applications
		can begin using the API immediately by <link xlink:href="#retrieving-lod">consuming it
		as Linked Open Data</link>.
	</tip>

	<section xml:id="api-basics">
		<title>The basics</title>
		<para>
		  As a Linked Open Data service,
		  the API is accessed by making an HTTP <literal>GET</literal> request
		  to the public endpoint,
		  <uri><link xlink:href="http://acropolis.org.uk/">http://acropolis.org.uk/</link></uri>,
		  including a <literal>Accept</literal> request header describing the
		  RDF serialisations that your application supports.
		</para>
		<para>
		  This operation is known as <emphasis>de-referencing</emphasis> a URI,
		  which translates as “given a Linked Data URI for something, retrieve
		  data that describes that thing”.
		</para>
		<para>
		  For example, de-referencing the URI for the <emphasis>root</emphasis>
		  of the API retrieves data about the API itself—in particular
		  information about the collections and supported queries provided by
		  it (see
		  <cite><citetitle><link xlink:href="#query-capabilities">Determine browse and query capabilities</link></citetitle></cite>,
		  below, for further details).
		</para>
		<para>
		  An application preferring to receive Turtle in response,
		  and N-Triples instead if that's available, an application would send
		  a request similar to the below:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: acropolis.org.uk
Accept: text/turtle;q=1.0, application/n-triples;q=0.95, application/rdf+xml;q=0.5
]]></programlisting>
		<para>
		  For data to be included in the Research &amp; Education Space,
		  it must have been published as Linked Open Data <emphasis>either</emphasis>
		  as Turtle or RDF/XML, and so applications must support parsing at
		  <emphasis role="strong">least both</emphasis> of these
		  serialisations—although applications are free to support processing
		  other types of response.
		</para>
		<warning>
		  <para>
			If you don’t send an <literal>Accept</literal> header,
			the server will send a response in whatever format it’s configured
			to default to, which can change at any time and may not be
			optimal for data processing (for example, the HTML view of the
			data).
		  </para>
		</warning>
		<para>
		  Meanwhile, to retrieve data about the entity which has the URI
		  <uri><link xlink:href="http://acropolis.org.uk/824ac9e32f8b48b48a54be3c069f95bc#id">http://acropolis.org.uk/824ac9e32f8b48b48a54be3c069f95bc#id</link></uri>, the application would make the following request:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[GET /824ac9e32f8b48b48a54be3c069f95bc HTTP/1.1
Host: acropolis.org.uk
Accept: text/turtle;q=1.0, application/n-triples;q=0.95, application/rdf+xml;q=0.5
]]></programlisting>
		<para>
		  Notice that the fragment portion of the URI—<literal>#id</literal>—is
		  not included in the HTTP request: this is specified by the
		  HTTP protocol specification itself. When your application
		  processes the response, it should begin with the triples whose
		  subject is the exact URI (including the fragment) of the entity
		  it was attempting to retrieve. See
		  <cite><citetitle><link xlink:href="#retrieving-lod">Retrieving
		  and processing Linked Open Data</link></citetitle></cite> for
		  a detailed description of the protocol, and
      <cite><citetitle><link xlink:href="developer-best-practices">Best practices</link></citetitle></cite>
		  for tips and guidance in avoiding common issues that can arise.
		</para>

	<section xml:id="testing-requests">
	  <title>Testing requests on the command-line</title>
	  <para>
		The <command>curl</command> command-line utility can be used
		to test requests to the API (the output below is abbreviated,
		but you can run the same command yourself to examine the full
		response). Simply supply an appropriate <literal>Accept</literal>
		request header and the URI to dereference. The <literal>-v</literal>
		option in the below enables verbose output from <command>curl</command>
		itself:
