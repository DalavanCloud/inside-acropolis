  <title>Find equivalent resources</title>

  <para>
	Linked Open Data in general, and the Research &amp; Education Space
	in particular, is at its most useful when the data describing things
	with links to other data describing the same thing.
  </para>

  <para>
	In RDF, this is achieved using the <literal>owl:sameAs</literal>
	predicate. This predicate implies a direct equivalence
	relationship—in effect, it creates a synonym.
  </para>

  <para>
	For example, a dataset might specify that a book has an ISBN
	using the <literal>urn:isbn:</literal> URN scheme
	<citation><link xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3187">RFC3187</link></citation>:
  </para>

  <programlisting language="turtle"><![CDATA[</books/9781899066100#id> owl:sameAs <urn:isbn:9781899066100> .]]></programlisting>

  <para>
	The data may also indicate that the book described refers to
	the same book at the British Library:
  </para>

  <programlisting language="turtle"><![CDATA[</books/9781899066100#id> owl:sameAs ]]>&lt;<link xlink:href="http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/011012558">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/011012558</link>&gt; .</programlisting>

	<para>
	  When an application retrieves data from the index about an
	  entity, the Research &amp; Education Space includes information
	  about all of the identifiers it has encountered which refer
	  to that entity. This information is expressed as a series of
	  <literal>owl:sameAs</literal> statements where the subject is
	  the URI encountered in the source data, and the object is
	  the <literal>http://acropolis.org.uk/…</literal> URI that was
	  automatically assigned by the Research &amp; Education Space
	  platform.
	</para>

	<note>
	  If you retrieve quads, rather than triples, from the index,
	  these assertions are placed in a graph whose URI begins with
	  <literal>http://acropolis.org.uk/</literal>, because the
	  statements are generated by the platform itself and should
	  be distinguished from statements made in the source data.
