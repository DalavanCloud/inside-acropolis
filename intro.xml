	<title>An introduction to the Acropolis platform</title>
	<para>
		The Acropolis platform is made of up three main components: a specialised web crawler, <firstterm>Anansi</firstterm>, an <firstterm>aggregator</firstterm>, <firstterm>Spindle</firstterm>, and a public API layer, <firstterm>Quilt</firstterm>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Anansi’s role is to crawl the web, retrieving <link xlink:href="#licenses">permissively-licensed</link> <link xlink:href="#lod">Linked Open Data</link>, and passing it to the aggregator for processing. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Spindle examines the data, looking for instances where the same digital, physical or conceptual entity is described in more than one place, primarily where the data <link xlink:href="#sameas">explicitly states the equivalence</link>, and aggregates and stores that information in an index.
	</para>
	<para>
		This <firstterm>subject-oriented</firstterm> index is the very heart of RES: by re-arranging published data so that it's organised around the entities described by it, instead of by publisher or data-set, applications are able to rapidly locate all of the information known about a particular entity because it’s collected together in one place.
	</para>
	<para>
		Quilt is responsible for making the index available to applications, also by publishing it as Linked Open Data. Because RES maintains an <emphasis>index</emphasis>, rather than a complete copy of all data that it finds, applications must consume data both from the RES index and from the original data sources—and consequentially Quilt itself also conforms to the publishing recommendations in this book.
	</para>
	<para>
		The RES project will not be directly developing end-user applications, although sample code and demonstrations will be published to assist software developers in doing so. RES only indexes and publishes data released under terms which permit re-use in both commercial and non-commercial settings.
	</para>
	<para>
		For RES to be most useful, holders of publicly-funded archive collections across the UK need to publish Linked Open Data describing their collections (including digital assets, where they exist). Although many collections are already doing so or plan to, the RES project partners will be providing tools and advice to collection-holders in order to assist them throughout the lifetime of the project.
