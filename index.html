		The <i class="firstterm">Research &amp; Education Space</i> is a platform being jointly delivered by <a href="http://jisc.ac.uk">Jisc</a>, the <a href="http://bufvc.ac.uk">British Universities Film &amp; Video Council</a> (BUFVC), and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>. Its aim is to bring as much as possible of the UK’s publicly-held archives, and more besides, to learners and teachers across the UK.
	</p>
	<p>
		Powering the Research &amp; Education Space is <i class="firstterm">Acropolis</i>, a technical stack which collects, indexes and organises rich structured data about those archive collections published as <i class="firstterm">Linked Open Data</i> (LOD) on the Web. The collected data is organised around the people, places, events, concepts and things related to the items in the archive collections—and, if the archive assets themselves are available in digital form, that data includes the information on how to access them, all in a consistent machine-readable form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Building on the Research &amp; Education Space, applications can make use of this index, along with the source data itself, to make those collections accessible and meaningful.
	</p>
	<p>
		This book describes how a collection-holder can publish their data in a form which can be collected and indexed by the platform and used by applications, and how an application developer can make use of the index and interpret the source data in order to present it to end-users in a useful fashion.

	<section id="intro" class="chapter"><h1>An introduction to the Acropolis platform</h1>
	
	<p>
		The Acropolis platform is made of up three main components: a specialised web crawler, <i class="firstterm">Anansi</i>, an <i class="firstterm">aggregator</i>, <i class="firstterm">Spindle</i>, and a public API layer, <i class="firstterm">Quilt</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anansi’s role is to crawl the web, retrieving <a href="#licenses">permissively-licensed</a> <a href="#lod">Linked Open Data</a>, and passing it to the aggregator for processing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Spindle examines the data, looking for instances where the same digital, physical or conceptual entity is described in more than one place, primarily where the data <a href="#sameas">explicitly states the equivalence</a>, and aggregates and stores that information in an index.
	</p>
	<p>
		This <i class="firstterm">subject-oriented</i> index is the very heart of RES: by re-arranging published data so that it's organised around the entities described by it, instead of by publisher or data-set, applications are able to rapidly locate all of the information known about a particular entity because it’s collected together in one place.
	</p>
	<p>
		Quilt is responsible for making the index available to applications, also by publishing it as Linked Open Data. Because RES maintains an <em>index</em>, rather than a complete copy of all data that it finds, applications must consume data both from the RES index and from the original data sources—and consequentially Quilt itself also conforms to the publishing recommendations in this book.
	</p>
	<p>
		The RES project will not be directly developing end-user applications, although sample code and demonstrations will be published to assist software developers in doing so. RES only indexes and publishes data released under terms which permit re-use in both commercial and non-commercial settings.
	</p>
	<p>
		For RES to be most useful, holders of publicly-funded archive collections across the UK need to publish Linked Open Data describing their collections (including digital assets, where they exist). Although many collections are already doing so or plan to, the RES project partners will be providing tools and advice to collection-holders in order to assist them throughout the lifetime of the project.
	</p>
</section>
	<section id="lod" class="chapter"><h1>Linked Open Data: What is it, and how does it work?</h1>
	
	
	<p>
		Linked Open Data is a mechanism for publishing structured data on the Web about virtually anything, in a form which can be consistently retrieved and processed by software. The result is a world wide web of data which works in parallel to the web of documents our browsers usually access, transparently using the same protocols and infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where the ordinary web of documents is a means of publishing a page about something intended for a human being to understand, this web of data is a means of publishing data about those things.
	</p>
		
	<section id="uris" class="section"><h1>Web addresses, URLs and URIs</h1>
		
		<p>
			<i class="firstterm">Uniform Resource Locators</i> (URLs), often known as <i class="firstterm">Web addresses</i>, are a way of unambiguously identifying something which is published electronically. Although there are a variety of kinds of URL, most that you day-to-day see begin with <code class="literal">http</code> or <code class="literal">https</code>: this is known as the <i class="firstterm">scheme</i>, and defines how the rest of the URL is structured—although most kinds of URL follow a common structure.
		</p>
		<p>
			The scheme also indicates the communications protocol which should be used to access the resource identified by the URL: if it's <code class="literal">http</code>, then the resource is accessible using HTTP—the protocol used by web servers and browsers; if it's <code class="literal">https</code>, then it’s accessible using secure HTTP (i.e., HTTP with added encryption).
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				The act of accessing the resource identified by a URL is known as <i class="firstterm">resolving</i> it.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			Following the scheme in a URL is the <i class="firstterm">authority</i>—the domain name of the web site: it’s called the authority because it identifies the entity responsible for defining the meaning and structure of the remainder of the URL. If the URL begins with <code class="uri">http://www.bbc.co.uk/</code>, you know that it's defined and managed by the BBC; if it begins with <code class="uri">http://www.bfi.org.uk/</code>, you know that it's managed by the BFI, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the authority is an optional <i class="firstterm">path</i> (i.e., the location of the document within the context of the particular domain name or authority), and optional <i class="firstterm">query parameters</i> (beginning with a question-mark), and <i class="firstterm">fragment</i> (beginning with a hash-mark).
		</p>
		<p>
			URLs serve a dual purpose: not only do they provide a name for something, but they also provide anything which understands them with the information they need to retrieve it. Provided your application is able to speak the HTTP protocol, it should in principle be able to retrieve anything using a <code class="literal">http</code> URL.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i class="firstterm">Universal Resource Indicators</i> (URIs) are a superset of URLs, and are in effect a kind of <i class="firstterm">universal identifier</i>: their purpose is to name something, without <em>necessarily</em> indicating how to retrieve it. In fact, it may be that the thing named using a URI cannot possibly be retrieved using a piece of software and an Internet connection because it refers to an abstract concept or a physical object.
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>In other words, while URLs are used specifically to identify digital resources which can be retrieved from a Web server, URIs can be used to identify anything: the URLs we use in our browsers are all URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			URIs follow the same structure as URLs, in that there is a scheme defining how the remainder is structured, and usually some kind of authority, but there are many different schemes, and many of them do not have any particular mechanism defined for how you might retrieve something named using that scheme.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, the <code class="literal"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4151">tag:</a></code> URI scheme provides a means for anybody to define a name for something in the form of a URI, using a domain name that they control as an authority, but without indicating any particular semantics about the thing being named.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, URIs which begin with <code class="literal">urn:</code> are actually part of one of a number of <em>sub-schemes</em>, many of which exist as a means of writing down some existing identifier about something in the form of a URI. For example, an <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr> can be written as a URI by prefixing it with <code class="literal">urn:isbn:</code> (for example, <code class="uri">urn:isbn:9781899066100</code>).
		</p>
		<p>
			You might be forgiven for wondering why somebody might want to write an ISBN in the form of a URI, but in fact there are a few reasons. In most systems, ISBNs are effectively opaque alphanumeric strings: although there is usually some validation of the check digit upon data entry, once stored in a database, they are rarely interrogated for any particular meaning. Given this, ISBNs work perfectly well for identifying books for which ISBNs have been issued—but what if you want to store data about other kinds of things, too? Recognising that this was a particular need for retailers, a few years ago ISBNs were made into a subset of <i class="firstterm">Global Trade Information Numbers</i> (GTINs), the system used for barcoding products sold in shops.
		</p>
		<p>
			By unifying ISBNs and GTINs, retailers were able to use the same field in their database systems for any type of product being sold, whether it was a book with an ISBN, or some other kind of product with a GTIN. All the while, the identifier remained essentially opaque: provided the string of digits and letters scanned by the bar-code reader could be matched to a row in a database, it doesn't matter precisely what those letters and numbers actually are.
		</p>
		<p>
			Representing identifiers in the form of URIs can be thought of as another level of generalisation: it allows the development of systems where the underlying database doesn’t need to know nor care about the <em>kind</em> of identifier being stored, and so can store information about absolutely anything which can be identified by a URI. In many cases, this doesn’t represent a huge technological shift—those database systems already pay little attention to the structure of the identifier itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hand-in-hand with this generalisation effect is the ability to disambiguate and harmonise without needing to coordinate a variety of different standards bodies across the world. Whereas the integration of ISBNs and GTINs took a particular concerted effort in order to achieve, the integration of ISBNs and URNs was only a matter of defining the URN scheme, because URIs are already designed to be open-ended and extensible.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i class="firstterm">Linked Open Data URIs</i> are a subset of URIs which, again, begin with <code class="literal">http:</code> or <code class="literal">https:</code>, but do not necessarily name something which can be retrieved from a web server. Instead, they are URIs where performing resolution results in machine-readable data <em>about</em> the entity being identified.
		</p>
		<p>
			In summary:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Term</th><th scope="col">Used for…</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>URLs</td><td>Identifying digital resources and specifying where they can be retrieved from</td></tr><tr><td>URIs</td><td>Identifying <em>anything</em>, regardless of whether it can be retrieved electronically or not</td></tr><tr><td>Linked Open Data URIs</td><td>Identifying anything, but in a way which means that <i class="firstterm">descriptive metadata</i> can be retrieved when the URI is resolved</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
	</section>
	
	<section id="triples" class="section"><h1>Describing things with triples</h1>
		
		<p>
			Linked Open Data uses the <i class="firstterm">Resource Description Framework</i> (RDF) to convey information about things. RDF is an open-ended system for modelling information about things, which it does by breaking it down into statements (or <i class="firstterm">assertions</i>), each of which consists of a <i class="firstterm">subject</i>, a <i class="firstterm">predicate</i> and an <i class="firstterm">object</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The subject is the thing being described; the predicate is the aspect or attribute of the subject being described; and the object is the description of that particular attribute.
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				If you are familiar with object-oriented programming, you may find it useful to think of a subject as being an <em>instance</em>, a predicate as a <em>property</em>, and an object as a <em>value</em>. In fact, the terms are often used interchangeably.
			</p>
		</aside>
	
		<p>
			For example, you might want to state that the book with the ISBN 978-1899066100 has the title <cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite>. You can break this assertion down into its subject, predicate, and object:
		</p>
	
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ISBN 978-1899066100</td><td>Has the title</td><td><cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
	
		<p>
			Together, this statement made up of a subject, predicate and object is called a <i class="firstterm">triple</i> (because there are three components to it), while a collection of statements is called a <i class="firstterm">graph</i>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			In RDF, the subject and the predicate are expressed as URIs this helps to remove ambiguity and the risk of clashes so that the data can be published and consumed in the same way regardless of where it comes from or who’s processing it. Objects <em>can</em> be expressed as URIs where you want to assert some kind of reference to something else, but can also be <i class="firstterm">literals</i> (such as text, numeric values, dates, and so on).
		</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id="predicates-vocabs" class="section"><h1>Predicates and vocabularies</h1>
		
		<p>
			RDF doesn’t specify the meaning of most predicates itself: in other words, RDF doesn’t tell you what URI you should use to indicate “has the title”. Instead, because anybody can create a URI, it’s entirely up to you whether you invent your own vocabulary when you publish your data, or adopt somebody else’s. Generally, of course, if you want other people to be able to understand your data, it’s probably a good idea to adopt existing vocabularies where they exist.
		</p>
		<p>
			In essence, RDF provides the grammar, while community consensus provides the dictionary.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most commonly-used general-purpose vocabularies is the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms</a>, managed by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), and which includes a suitable title predicate:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ISBN 978-1899066100</td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title ">http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</a></code></td><td><cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		<p>
			With this triple, a consuming application that understands the DCMI Metadata Terms vocabulary can process that data and understand the predicate to indicate that the item has the title <cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite>.
		</p>
		<aside class="info">
			<p>
				The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative and the core of the DCMI Metadata Terms vocabulary pre-date RDF and Linked Open Data by some years: older vocabularies and classification schemes have been routinely adapted and re-purposed for RDF as it’s become more widely used as an approach to representing structured data.
			</p>
		</aside>
		
		<p>
			Because <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title ">http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</a></code> is quite long-winded, it’s common to write predicate URIs in a compressed form, consisting of a namespace prefix and local name—similar to the <code class="literal">xmlns</code> mechanism used in XML documents.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Because people will often use the same prefix to refer to the same namespace URI, it is not unusual to see this short form of URIs used in books and web pages. Some common prefixes and namespace URIs are shown below:
		</p>
		
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Vocabulary</th><th scope="col">Namespace URI</th><th scope="col">Often abbreviated as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/">RDF Syntax</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">rdf:</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PER-rdf-schema-20140109/">RDF Schema</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#">http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">rdfs:</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">foaf:</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://vocab.deri.ie/void">Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://rdfs.org/ns/void#">http://rdfs.org/ns/void#</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">void:</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		
		<p>
			For example, defining the namespace prefix <code class="literal">dct</code> with a namespace URI of <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/    ">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</a></code>, we can write our predicate as <code class="literal">dct:title</code> instead of <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title">http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</a></code>.
			RDF systems re-compose the complete URI by concatenating the prefix URI and the local name.
		</p>

	<section id="subject-uris" class="section"><h1>Subject URIs</h1>
		
		<p>
			In RDF, subjects are also URIs. While in RDF itself there are no particular restrictions upon the kind of URIs you can use (and there are a great many different kinds — those beginning <code class="literal">http:</code> and <code class="literal">https:</code> that you see on the Web are just two of hundreds), Linked Open Data places some restrictions on subject URIs in order to function. These are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Subject URIs must begin with <code class="literal">http:</code> or <code class="literal">https:</code>.</li>
			<li>They must be unique: although you can have multiple URIs for the same thing, one URI can’t refer to multiple distinct things at once.</li>
			<li>If a Linked Open Data consumer makes an HTTP request for the subject URI, the server should send back RDF data describing that subject.</li>
			<li>As with URLs, subject URIs need to be persistent: that is, they should change as little as possible, and where they do change, you need to be able to make arrangements for requests for the old URI to be forwarded to the new one.
				</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In practice, this means that when you decide upon a subject URI, it needs to be within a domain name that you control and can operate a web server for; you need to have a scheme for your subject URIs which distinguishes between things which are represented digitally (and so have ordinary URLs) and things which cannot; you also need to arrange for your web server to actually serve RDF when it’s requested; and finally you need to decide a form for your subject URIs which minimises changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			This may sound daunting, but it can be quite straightforward—and shares much in common with deciding upon a URL structure for a website that is intended only for ordinary browsers.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, if you are the <i class="firstterm">Intergalactic Alliance Library &amp; Museum</i>, whose domain name is <code class="literal">ialm.int</code>, you might decide that all of your books’ URIs will begin with <code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/</code>, and use the full 13-digit ISBN, without dashes, as the key. You could pick something other than the ISBN, such as an identifier meaningful only to your own internal systems, but it makes developers’ lives easier if you incorporate well-known identifiers where it’s not problematic to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because this web of data co-exists with the web of documents, begin by defining the URL to the <em>document</em> about this book:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>

		<p>
			Anybody visiting that URL in their browser will be provided with information about the book in your collection. Because the URL incorporates a well-known identifier, the ISBN, if any other pieces of information about the book change or are corrected, that URL remains stable. As a bonus, incorporating the ISBN means that the URL to the document is predictable.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="info">
			<p>
				Of course, the ISBN may have been entered incorrectly (or may be cancelled by the registration authority), and it would be worth planning for that eventuality—but assuming that your collection website’s data is based upon information that is used operationally day-to-day, the risk of that needing to occur is kept to a minimum.
			</p>
		</aside>
		
		<p>
			Having defined the URL for book pages, it’s now time to define the rest of the structure. The Intergalactic Alliance Library &amp; Museum web server will be configured to serve web pages to web browsers, and RDF data to RDF consumers: that is, there are multiple representations of the same data. It’s useful, from time to time, to be able to refer to each of these representations with a distinct URL. Let’s say, then, that we’ll use the general form:
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.EXT</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
			
		<p>
			In this case, <code class="literal">EXT</code> refers to the well-known <i class="firstterm">filename extension</i> for the particular type of representation we’re referring to.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				Media types (sometimes also called MIME types or content types) are registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The registration document includes the preferred or commonly-used filename extensions for that type. For example, the registration document for HTML can be found <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/html">on the IANA website</a>.
			</p>
		</aside>
		
		<p>
			Therefore, the HTML web page for our book will have the <i class="firstterm">representation-specific</i> URL of:
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.html</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>

		<p>
			If you also published CSV data for your book, it could be given the representation-specific URL of:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.csv</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
		
		<p>
			RDF can be expressed in a number of different forms, or serialisations. The most commonly-used serialisation is called <i class="firstterm">Turtle</i>, and typically has the filename extension of <code class="literal">ttl</code>. Therefore our Turtle serialisation would have the representation-specific URL of:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.ttl</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
		
		<p>
			Now that we have defined the structure of our URLs, we can define the pattern used for the subject URIs themselves. Remember that the URI needs to be <i class="firstterm">dereferenceable</i>—that is, when a consuming application makes a request for it, the server can respond with the appropriate representation.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to do this, there are two options: we can use a special kind of redirect, or we can use fragments.  The fragment approach works best where you have a document for each individual item, as we do here, and takes advantage of the fact that in the HTTP protocol, any part of a URL following the “#” symbol is never sent to the server.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, let’s say that we’ll distinguish our URLs from our subject URIs by suffixing the subject URIs with <code class="literal">#id</code>. The URI for our book therefore becomes:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
		
		<p>
			When an application requests the information about this book, by the time it arrives at our web server, it’s been turned into a request for the very first URL we defined—the generic “document about this book” URL:
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
		
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				The reason the “fragment” portion of the URI is stripped off the request by the time it arrives at the web server is because the HTTP protocol states that fragments are never sent <i class="firstterm">over the wire</i>—that is, they are not included in the protocol exchange between the client and the server. Their original use was to identify a section within a web page and allow a browser to skip straight to it even though it requested and was served the whole page. Fragments in <em>URLs</em> are regularly used for this purpose today.
			</p>
		</aside>
		
		<p>
			When an application understands RDF and tells the server as much as part of the request, the server can send back the Turtle representation instead of an HTML web page—a part of the HTTP protocol known as <i class="firstterm">content negotiation</i>. Content negotiation allows a server to pick the most appropriate representation for something (where it has multiple representations), based upon the client’s preferences.
		</p>
		<p>
			With our subject URI pattern defined, we can revisit our original assertion:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:title</code></td><td><cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		
	</section>
	
	<section id="classes" class="section"><h1>Defining what something is: classes</h1>
		
		<p>
			One of the few parts of the common vocabulary which is defined by RDF itself is the predicate <code class="literal">rdf:type</code>, which specifies the class (or classes) of a subject. Like predicates, classes are defined by vocabularies, and are also expressed as URIs. The classes of a subject are intended to convey what that subject <em>is</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, the Bibliographic Ontology, whose namespace URI is <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/">http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/</a></code> (commonly prefixed as <code class="literal">bibo:</code>) defines a class named <code class="literal">bibo:Book</code> (whose full URI we can deduce as being <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Book">http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Book</a></code>).
		</p>
		<p>
			If we write a triple which asserts that our book is a <code class="literal">bibo:Book</code>, any consumers which understand the Bibliographic Ontology can interpret our data as referring to a book:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></td><td><code class="literal">rdf:type</code></td><td><code class="literal">bibo:Book</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:title</code></td><td><cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		
	</section>
	
	<section id="describing" class="section"><h1>Describing things defined by other people</h1>
		
		
		<p>
			There is no technical reason why your subject URIs must <em>only</em> be URIs that you control directly. In Linked Open Data, the matter of <em>trust</em> is a matter for the data consumer: one application might have a white-list of trusted sources, another might have a black-list of sources known to be problematic, another might have more complex heuristics, while another might use your social network such that assertions from your friends are considered more likely to be trustworthy than those from other people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Describing subjects defined by other people has a practical purpose. Predicates work in a particular direction, and although sometimes vocabularies will define pairs of predicates so that you can make a statement either way around, interpreting this begins to get complicated, and so most vocabularies define predicates only in one direction.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an example, you might wish to state that a book held in a library is about a subject that you’re describing. On a web page, you’d simply write this down and link to it—perhaps as part of a “Useful resources” section. In Linked Open Data, you can make the assertion that one of the subjects of the other library’s book is the one you’re describing. This works exactly the same way as if you were describing something that you’d defined yourself—you simply write the statement, but somebody else’s URI as the subject.
		</p>
		<p>
			This can also be used to make life easier for developers and reduce network overhead of applications. In your “Useful resources” section, you probably wouldn’t only list the URL to the page about the book: instead, you’d list the title and perhaps the author <em>as well</em> as linking to the page about the book. You can do that in Linked Open Data, too. Let’s say that we’re expressing the data about a subject—Roman Gaul—which we’ve assigned a URI of <code class="uri">http://ialm.int/things/2068003#id</code>:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/things/2068003#id</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:title</code></td><td><cite>Roman Gaul</cite></td></tr><tr><td><code class="uri">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/006889069</code></td><td><code class="literal">rdf:type</code></td><td><code class="literal">bibo:Book</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="uri">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/006889069</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:title</code></td><td><cite>Asterix the Gaul</cite></td></tr><tr><td><code class="uri">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/006889069</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:subject</code></td><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/things/2068003#id</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		<p>
			In this example we’ve defined a subject, called <cite>Roman Gaul</cite>, of which we’ve provided very little detail, except to say that it’s a subject of the book <cite>Asterix the Gaul</cite>, whose identifier is defined by the British Library.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that we haven‘t described the book <cite>Asterix the Gaul</cite> in full: RDF operates on an <i class="firstterm">open world principle</i>, which means that sets of assertions are generally interpreted as being incomplete—or rather, only as complete as they need to be. The fact that we haven’t specified an author or publisher of the book doesn’t mean there isn’t one, just that the data isn’t present here; where in RDF you need to state explicitly that something doesn’t exist, there is usually a particular way to do that.
		</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id="turtle" class="section"><h1>Turtle: the terse triple language</h1>
		
		<p>
			<i class="firstterm">Turtle</i> is one of the most common languages for writing RDF in use today—although there are many others. Turtle is intended to be interpreted and generated by machines first and foremost, but also be readable and writeable by human beings (albeit usually software developers).
		</p>
		<p>
			In its simplest form, we can just write out our statements, one by one, each separated by a full stop. URIs are written between angle-brackets (<code class="literal">&lt;</code> and <code class="literal">&gt;</code>), while <i class="firstterm">string literals</i> (such as the names of things) are written between double-quotation marks (<code class="literal">"</code>).
		</p>
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Book&gt; .
	
&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/title&gt; "Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging" .</code></pre>
		<p>
			This is quite long-winded, but fortunately Turtle allows us to define and use prefixes just as we have in this book. When we write the short form of a URI, it’s <em>not</em> written between angle-brackets:
		</p>
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix bibo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/&gt; .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; rdf:type bibo:Book .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; dct:title "Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging" .</code></pre>
		<p>
			Because Turtle is designed for RDF, and <code class="literal">rdf:type</code> is defined by RDF itself, Turtle
			provides a nice shorthand for the predicate: <code class="literal">a</code>. We can simply say that our book is <code class="literal">a bibo:Book</code>:
		</p>
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix bibo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/&gt; .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; a bibo:Book .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; dct:title "Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging" .</code></pre>
		<p>
			Writing the triples out this way quickly gets repetitive: you don’t want to be writing the subject URI every time, especially not if writing Turtle by hand. If you end a statement with a semi-colon instead of a full-stop, it indicates that what follows is another predicate and object about the same subject:
		</p>
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix bibo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/&gt; .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt;
	a bibo:Book ;
	dct:title "Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging" .</code></pre>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				If you end a statement with a comma instead of a semi-colon or full-stop, it means that what follows is another object with the same subject and predicate—in other words, it’s a quick way of writing multiple values.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			Turtle includes a number of capabilities which we haven’t yet discussed here, but are important for
			fully understanding real-world RDF in general and Turtle documents in particular. These include:
		</p>
		<dl>
				<dt>Typed literals</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						<i class="firstterm">Typed literals</i>: literals which aren’t simply strings of text, but can be of any one of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML Schema data types</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						 Literal types are indicated by writing the literal value, followed by two carets, and then the datatype URI: for example, <code class="literal">"2013-01-26"^^xsd:date</code>.					
					</p>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Blank nodes</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Blank nodes are entities for which some information is provided, but where the subject
						URI is not known. There are two different ways of using blank nodes in Turtle: a blank node <em>value</em> is one where in place of a URI or a literal value, an entity is partially described.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another way of using blank nodes is to assign it a private, transient identifier (a blank node identifier), and then use that identifier where you’d normally use a URI as a subject or object. The transient identifier has no meaning outside of the context of the document: it’s simply a way of referring to the same (essentially anonymous) entity in multiple places within the document.
					</p>
					<p>
						A blank node value is expressed by writing an opening square bracket, followed by the sets of predicates and values for the blank node, followed by a closing square bracket. For example, we can state that an author of the book is a nondescript entity who we know is a person named <code class="literal">Nicola Strickland</code>, but for whom we don’t have an identifier:
					</p>
					<pre class="code turtle"><code>&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; dct:creator [
	a foaf:Person ;
	foaf:name "Nicola Strickland" 
] .</code></pre>
					<p>
						Blank node identifiers are written similarly to the compressed form of URIs, except that an underscore is used as the prefix. For example, <code class="literal">_:johnsmith</code>. You don’t have to do anything special to create a blank node identifier (simply use it), and the actual name you assign has no meaning outside of the context of the document—if you replace all instances of <code class="literal">_:johnsmith</code> with <code class="literal">_:zebra</code>, the actual meaning of the document is unchanged—although it may be slightly more confusing to read and write as a human.
					</p>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Multi-lingual string literals</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String literals in the examples given so far are written in no particular language (which may be appropriate in some cases, particularly when expressing people’s names).
					</p>
					<p>
						The language used for a string literal is indicated by writing the literal value, followed by an at-sign, and then the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1 language code</a>, or an ISO 639-1 language code, followed by a hyphen, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example: <code class="literal">"Intergalatic Alliance Library &amp; Museum Homepage"@en</code>, or <code class="literal">"grey"@en-gb</code>.
					</p>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Base URIs</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						By default, the base URI for the terms in a Turtle document is the URI it’s being served from. Occasionally, it can be useful to specify an alternative base URI. To do this, an <code class="literal">@base</code> statement can be included (in a similar fashion to <code class="literal">@prefix</code>).
					</p>
					<p>For example, if a document specifies <code class="literal">@base &lt;http://www.example.com/things/&gt; .</code>, then the URI <code class="literal">&lt;12447652#id&gt;</code> within that document can be expanded to <code class="literal">&lt;http://www.example.com/things/12447652#id&gt;</code>, while the URI <code class="literal">&lt;/artefacts/47fb01&gt;</code> would be expanded to <code class="literal">&lt;http://www.example.com/artefacts/47fb01&gt;</code>.</p>

	<section id="quads" class="section"><h1>From three to four: relaying provenance with quads</h1>
		
		<p>
			While triples are a perfectly servicable mechanism for describing something, they don’t have the ability
			to tell you where data is <em>from</em> (unless you impose a restriction that you only deal
			with data where the domain of the subject URI matches that of the server you’re retrieving from). In some
			systems, including Acropolis, this limitation is overcome by introducing another element: a graph URI, identifying the <em>source</em> of a triple. Thus, instead of triples, RES actually stores <i class="firstterm">quads</i>.			
		</p>
		<p>
			When we assign an explicit URI to a graph in this way, it becomes known as a <i class="firstterm">named graph</i>—that is, a graph with an explicit identifier (name) assigned to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Turtle itself doesn’t have a concept of named graphs, but there is an extension to Turtle, named
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-trig-20140225/">TriG</a>, which includes the
			capability to specify the URI of a named graph containing a particular set of triples.
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				While Quilt will serve RDF/XML and Turtle when requested, it will also serve TriG: this allows
				applications to determine the provenance of statements stored in the RES index, allowing
				them to white– or black-list data sources if needed.

	</section>

	<section id="why-rdf" class="section"><h1>Why does RES use RDF?</h1>
		
		<p>
			RDF isn’t necessarily the simplest way of expressing some data about something, and that means it’s often not the first choice for publishers and consumers. Often, an application consuming some data is designed specifically for one particular dataset, and so its interactions are essentially bespoke and comparatively easy to define.  
		</p>
		<p>
			RES, by nature, brings together a large number of different structured datasets, describing lots of different kinds of things, with a need for a wide range of applications to be able to work with those sets in a consistent fashion.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the time of writing (ten years after its introduction), RDF’s use of URIs as identifiers, common vocabularies and data types, inherent flexibility and well-defined structure means that is the only option for achieving this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether you’re describing an audio clip or the year 1987, a printed book or the concept of a documentary film, RDF provides the ability to express the data you hold in intricate detail, without being beholden to a single central authority to validate the modelling work undertaken by experts in your field.
		</p>
		<p>
			For application developers, the separation of grammar and vocabularies means that applications can interpret data in as much or as little detail as is useful for the end-users. For instance, you might develop an application which understands a small set of general-purpose metadata terms but which can be used with virtually everything surfaced through RES.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, you might develop a specialist application which interprets rich descriptions in a particular domain in order to target specific use-cases. In either case, you don’t need to know who the data comes from, only sufficient understanding of the vocabularies in use to satisfy your needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, because we recognise that publishing and consuming Linked Open Data as an individual publisher or application developer may be unfamiliar territory, and so throughout the lifetime of the project we are committed to publishing documentation, developing tools and operating workshops in order to help developers and publishers work with RDF in general and RES in particular more easily.

		At the core of the platform is the <i class="firstterm">RES index</i>.
		This index is available as <a href="http://acropolis.org.uk/">web pages</a>
		(to make it easier for application developers to see what’s there and
		how it works), but is primarily published as Linked Open Data. Accessing
		the index and requesting machine-readable data is the RES platform API.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The RES index takes the form of a <code class="literal">void:Dataset</code>, and
		the operations that you might perform against the RES index will often
		be applicable to other datasets that you might encounter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Depending upon your application design, it may be desirable to offer
		the same browse and query capabilities to any dataset that the user
		navigates to, rather than hard-coding behaviour specific to the RES
		index.

		<p>
			The RES index is made up of a series of <i class="firstterm">composite</i>
			entities which are constructed using the data discovered by the
			crawler. Each of the composite entities has an <code class="literal">owl:sameAs</code>
			relationship with the various source entities used to construct it,
			a portion of whose data is cached in the index.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you dereference the URI for the RES index, the
			result is some metadata about the index itself, including information about
			how to perform different kinds of query, the different browseable
			partitions, and some selected sample entities.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a query is performed against the index (i.e., by adding some query
			parameters to the URI), the result is a small amount of metadata about
			the query and the results along with a list of these composite entities.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you then dereference one of these entities—<i class="firstterm">drilling down</i>
			into it—the document returned will contain both the composite entity, and
			the cached data about the source entities. If the entity references, or is
			referenced by other entities, the relevant composite entities are also
			included.

	<section id="consumers" class="chapter"><h1>Requirements for consuming applications</h1>
	
	
	<p>
		Applications built for RES must be able to understand the index assembled by Acropolis, as well as the source data it refers to. Practically, it means that they must be able to retrieve and process RDF from remote web servers and interpret at least the <a href="#common">common metadata</a> vocabularies described in this book which are relevant to the consuming application.
	</p>

	<section id="retrieving-lod" class="section"><h1>Retrieving and processing Linked Open Data</h1>
		
		<aside class="tip">
			Although it's useful to understand the mechanics of consuming
			Linked Open Data if you are developing applications for it,
			consumer libraries may exist for your preferred platform
			and programming language already. A list of some of these is
			included in <a href="#lod-consumer-tools">an appendix</a>
			at the end of this book.
		</aside>
		<p>
			In a perfect world, consuming Linked Open Data is as straightforward as:—
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
					Make a request for the URI you want to get data about, sending an
					<code>Accept</code> HTTP request header containing the MIME types of
					the formats you support in your application.
				</li>
			<li>
					Parse the data in the response using an RDF parser.
				</li>
			<li>
					Examine the parsed data to find triples whose subject is the URI that you
					started with.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			While this process is simple, and could be implemented using virtually any HTTP
			client in common use today, it brings about a few questions. How do you deal with
			redirects? What happens if the server doesn't return the data in the format that
			you asked for? Where do you <em>start</em>?
		</p>
		<p>
			This chapter aims to answer all of these questions so that your RES application
			can be both useful and robust in face of real-world challenges.
		</p>
		
		<section id="consuming-detail" class="section"><h1>Consuming Linked Open Data in detail</h1>
			
			
			<p>
				As part of the RES project, we are developing a <a href="https://bbcarchdev.github.io/liblod/">Linked
				Open Data client library</a>. Although at present this library is currently
				only available to low-level languages such as C and C++, the process
				it follows can be implemented in any language. It is intended to be a liberal
				consumer which can deal with real situations, such as different kinds of
				redirects and content negotiation failing or being disabled by the publisher.
			</p>
			<p>
				The algorithm is as follows (implemented in the LOD library in
				<a href="https://github.com/bbcarchdev/liblod/blob/master/fetch.c"><code class="filename">fetch.c</code></a>):—
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
						Optionally, check if data about the <var>request-URI</var>
						is present in our RDF model: if so, return a reference to it.
					</li>
				<li>
						Append <var>request-URI</var> to
						<var>subject-list</var>.
					</li>
				<li>
						If <var>request-URI</var> has a
						<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier">fragment</a>,
						remove it and store it as <var>fragment</var>.
					</li>
				<li>
						Set <var>followed-link</var> to <code class="constant">false</code>,
						and <var>count</var> to 0.
					</li>
				<li>
						If <var>count</var> is more than our configured
						<var>max-redirects</var> value, return an error status
						indicating that the redirect limit has been exceeded.
					</li>
				<li>
						Create an HTTP request for <var>request-URI</var>,
						setting the <code>Accept</code> header based upon the data
						formats supported by the application. Note that RES requires
						publishers and applications to support at
						<em>least</em> RDF/XML
						(<code class="constant">application/rdf+xml</code>) and Turtle
						(<code class="constant">text/turtle</code>), but both clients and servers
						may support other formats which can be negotiated.
					</li>
				<li>
						Perform the HTTP request. Note that this should be a single
						request-response pair, and not automatically follow redirects.
					</li>
				<li>
						If a low-level error in performing the request occurred (such as
						the hostname in the URI not being resolveable), return an error
						status indicating that the request could not be performed.
					</li>
				<li>
						Store the canonicalised form of <var>request-URI</var>
						as the <var>base</var>.
					</li>
				<li>
						Obtain the <code>Content-Type</code> of the response, if any, and store
						it in <var>content-type</var>.
					</li>

		<section id="starting" class="section"><h1>A starting point: the RES index</h1>
			
			<p>
				Just as an ordinary web browser needs a homepage or an address bar, so
				too do Linked Open Data applications. Whether your application has a fixed
				configured starting point or is intended to be an open-ended “data browser”,
				the RES index is intended to be a useful Linked Open Data home for many
				applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Described in more detail in <cite><a href="#api">The RES API: the index and how it’s structured</a></cite>,
				the index is itself Linked Open Data which can
				be retrieved and processed using the algorithms described above. The URI for
				the index is currently
				<code class="uri"><a href="http://beta.acropolis.org.uk/">http://beta.acropolis.org.uk</a></code>, and this URI
				can be used as default “homepage” for RES applications.
			</p>
			<aside class="warning">
				The URI to the API will change soon as the live version of the platform replaces
				the current beta.
			</aside>
			<p>
				In the same way that a homepage only provides the starting point for a web
				browser, the same is true of the RES index: applications can allow users
				to explore and search the index, but to also follow the onward links to
				source data and media assets.
			</p>
			<p>
				For some applications, use the RES index as a starting point won’t be
				appropriate: it may be necessary or useful to implement an intermediary
				service that provides additional capabilities or a specific curated
				subset of resources. There is no requirement that RES applications
				<em>must</em> directly use the base of the RES index
				as their home.

	<section id="editorial-guidelines-for-product-developers" class="section"><h1>Editorial Guidelines for Product Developers</h1>
		
		<p>
			What do we mean by “editorial”?
		</p>
		<p>
			In this context we mean what is <em>in</em> the metadata and the associated media, such as text, video or images.
		</p>
		<ul>	
			<li>What does it say and what is it about?</li>
			<li>Is it suitable for all ages to see and hear?</li>
			<li>Are there any limits you would want to set around who could see this material?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			When making metadata and media available in to education, it is important to understand the expectations of the audience in terms of what they will see and hear.
		</p>
		<p>
			These guidelines are intended to help product developers think about these issues as early in the design and development process as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			The RES platform is funded with public money and needs to show that it is serving the public interest and behaving responsibly.
		</p>
		<ul>	
			<li>The RES project envisages that in schools and FE colleges it will be teachers who are the primary users of the products built on top of the RES platform, both the catalogue and the assets.</li>
			<li>Teachers will then judge the suitability of the content for particular age ranges and make it available to pupils.</li>
			<li>The pupils and students will therefore be the secondary users of any products, accessing a moderated version of the whole platform.</li>
			<li>Teachers will need to share material with pupils and other teachers and this functionality will be vital.</li>
			<li>Where possible the metadata will include any guidance as to the suitability of the content for particular age groups, for example the BBC would include <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidance/help/">Guidance warning metadata</a>.</li>
			<li>How this will be displayed to teachers is an important consideration in the design of products and services.</li>
			<li>However where no such information is available, it needs to be clear that this does not mean that the material is necessarily suitable for all ages (so perhaps a “no age range given” tag is appropriate?)</li>
			<li>The RES project will provide teachers with guidelines about the range of material available in RES and hints on how to navigate and mediate such a large volume of metadata and media.</li>
			<li>Teachers will also form their own view of what material is suitable for whom, and their ability to add that information to the metadata and share it is important.</li>
			<li>Every product or service built on the RES platform must have a means of feeding back any concerns about aspects of the assets or the metadata to the provider of the catalogue and assets.</li>
		</ul>

	<section id="publishers" class="chapter"><h1>Requirements for publishers</h1>
	
	
	<p>
		Publishers wishing to make their data visible in the Acropolis index and useable by RES applications must conform to a small set of basic requirements. These are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The data must be expressed as RDF and published as Linked Open Data;</li>
		<li>the data must be licensed under permissive terms (in particular, it must allow re-use in both	commercial and non-commercial applications);</li>
		<li>the licensing terms must be included in the data itself so that consumers can perform automated due diligence before using it;</li>
		<li>the data should use the vocabularies described in this book for best results (although you are free to use other vocabularies too).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Although RES requires that you publish Linked Open Data, that doesn’t mean you can’t also publish your data in other ways. While human-facing HTML pages are the obvious example, there’s nothing about publishing Linked Open Data which means you can’t also publish JSON with a bespoke schema, CSV, OpenOffice.org spreadsheets, or operate complex query APIs requiring registration to use.
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact, best practice generally is that you publish in as many formats as you’re generally able to, and do so in a consistent fashion. And, while your “data views” (that is, the structured machine-readable representations of your data about things) are going to be very dull and uninteresting to most human beings, that doesn’t mean that you can’t serve nicely-designed web pages about them as the serialisation for ordinary web browsers.
	</p>
	<section id="publishing-detail" class="section"><h1>Checklist for data publication</h1>
		
		
		<section id="support-common-serialisations" class="section"><h1>Support the most common RDF serialisations</h1>
			
			<p>
				RDF can be serialised in a number of different ways, but there are two serialisations which RES publishers <strong class="strong">must</strong> provide because these are the two serialisations guaranteed to be supported by RES applications:
			</p>
			<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Name</th><th scope="col">Media type</th><th scope="col">Further information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Turtle</td><td><code class="literal">text/turtle</code></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-turtle-20140225/ ">http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-turtle-20140225/</a></code></td></tr><tr><td>RDF/XML</td><td><code class="literal">application/rdf+xml</code></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf-syntax-grammar-20140225/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf-syntax-grammar-20140225/</a></code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
			<p>
				Turtle is increasingly the most common RDF serialisation in circulation and is very widely-supported by processing tools and libraries.
			</p>
			<p>
				RDF/XML is an older serialisation which is slightly more well-supported than Turtle. RDF/XML is often more verbose than the equivalent Turtle expression of a graph, but as an XML-based format can be generated automatically from other kinds of XML using XSLT.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are considering publishing your data as JSON, you may consider publishing it as <a href="http://json-ld.org">JSON-LD</a>, a serialisation of RDF which is intended to be useful to consumers which don’t understand RDF specifically. JSON-LD isn’t currently supported by RES, but may be in the future.
			</p>
			<aside class="info">
				<p>The RES crawler will request Turtle by preference.</p>
			</aside>
		</section>
		
		<section id="self-describing-documents" class="section"><h1>Describe the document and serialisations as well as the item</h1>
			
			<p>				
				A minimal RDF serialisation intended for use by RES must include data about three distinct subjects:
			</p>
			<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Document URL</td><td><code class="literal">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100</code></td></tr><tr><td>Representation URL</td><td><code class="literal">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.ttl</code></td></tr><tr><td>Item URI</td><td><code class="literal">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
			<p>
				It is recommended that publishers describe any other serialisations which they are making available as well, but it is not currently a requirement to do so.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A description of the metadata which should be served about the document and representations is included in the <a href="#document-metadata">Metadata about documents</a> section.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="explicit-licensing" class="section"><h1>Include licensing information in the data</h1>
			
			<p>
				The data about the representation <strong class="strong">must</strong> include a rights information triple referring to the well-known URI of a supported license. See the <a href="#rights">Metadata describing rights and licensing</a> section for further details.
			</p>
			<aside class="warning">
				<p>
					The RES crawler will discard data which does not include licensing information, because without it the platform cannot determine nor relay whether it is suitable for use by RES applications.
				</p>
			</aside>
		</section>
		
		<section id="link-alternate" class="section"><h1>Link to the RDF representations from the HTML variant</h1>
			
			<p>
				In your HTML representations, use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element (within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element) with a <code class="literal">rel</code> attribute of <code class="literal">"alternate"</code> in order to link to the other representations of the same document:
			</p>
			<pre class="code html"><code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rdf+xml" href="/books/9781899066100.rdf"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate" type="text/turtle" href="/books/9781899066100.ttl"&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>
				While it’s less efficient than content negotiation (see below) for both consuming applications and for your server to access your alternative serialisations this way, linking to them from your HTML provides a useful fall-back capability in the event that content negotiation fails or has to be disabled—for example, if you need to switch your website to be served from a content delivery network which doesn’t support negotiation.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s not the preferred option because consumers must first obtain the HTML, parse it, and then request the RDF. Often, generating the HTML page will also be more expensive than generating the equivalent RDF serialisations.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="perform-conneg" class="section"><h1>Perform content negotiation when requests are received for item URIs</h1>
			
			<p>
				If you use fragment-based URIs, this means that your web server must be configured to perform content negotiation on requests received for the portion of the URI before the hash (<code class="literal">#</code>) sign.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if your subject URIs are in the form:
			</p>
			<blockquote><p><code class="literal">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></p><footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
			<p>
				Then when your server receives requests for the document:
			</p>
			<blockquote><p><code class="literal">/books/9781899066100</code></p><footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
			<p>
				It should perform content negotiation and return an appropriate media type, including the supported RDF serialisations if requested.

		<p>
			When making metadata and media available in to education, it is important to understand the expectations of the users in terms of what they will see and hear.
		</p>
		<p>
			These guidelines are intended to help content providers think about these issues as early in the process as possible.

	<p>
		The Research &amp; Education Space will not directly consume or publish digital media (audio, video, images,
		documents) itself. However, it will aggregate data <em>about</em>
		digital media which has been published in a form which can be used consistently
		by applications built on the platform.
	</p>
	<p>
		This chapter describes how those media assets can be published in ways which will be
		most useful to applications, while balancing the range of access mechanisms and
		rights restrictions applicable to users in educational settings.
	</p>
	<p>
		While this chapter provides guidance on publishing media assets themselves, those
		assets only become useful to within the Research &amp; Education Space when they are properly described
		in accompanying metadata. For more information on publishing data which describes
		digital media assets, please refer to the chapter <cite><a href="#assets">Describing digital assets</a></cite>.
	</p>
	
	
	<section id="media-publication" class="section"><h1>Approaches to publication</h1>
		
		<p>
			There are three strategies for publishing media for the Research &amp; Education Space:
			<a href="#media-direct">publishing “raw” media assets</a>,
			providing <a href="#media-frame">embeddable players</a>,
			and publishing <a href="#media-page">pages which
			include playback capabilities</a>.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				A media publisher may make use of any or all of these strategies, possibly combined
				with access-control mechanisms where rights or other legal restrictions require it.
			</p>
		</aside>
		
		<section id="media-direct" class="section"><h1>Publishing media directly</h1>
			
		
			<p>
				Publishing media directly is most suited to situations where the media assets
				are openly-licensed and can be both downloaded and streamed by
				applications. It is not suitable for media which is rights-restricted to the
				extent that downloads are not permitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Direct publishing allows an application to make use of native playback,
				viewing, editing, and tagging capabilities, and consequentially offers the
				greatest level of flexibility to applications and users alike. While it provides
				no technical barrier to end-users <em>sharing</em> downloaded media
				(in whole or part on its own, or combined into a larger composition), it does
				not automatically imply that sharing is permitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				While affording the greatest level of flexibility to the consuming application,
				publishing media in this way is also the simplest from a technical perspective: the
				encoded media files are simply uploaded to a web server and then
				<cite><a href="#av">described in the accompanying metadata</a></cite>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use direct publication where:—
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
						Licensing allows both streaming <em>and</em> download of
						the media asset.
					</li>
				<li>
						If you want to allow snipping or other kinds of editing of the media.
					</li>
				<li>
						You want to provide the widest possible range of device support.
					</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For example:—</p>
			
			<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Property</th><th scope="col">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Media asset URL</td><td><code class="uri"><a href="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Claude_Monet_1899_Nadar_crop.jpg">//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Claude_Monet_1899_Nadar_crop.jpg</a></code></td></tr><tr><td>MIME type</td><td><code class="constant">image/jpeg</code></td></tr><tr><td>Embeddable?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Poster image URL</td><td><code class="uri"><a href="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Claude_Monet_1899_Nadar_crop.jpg/180px-Claude_Monet_1899_Nadar_crop.jpg">//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Claude_Monet_1899_Nadar_crop.jpg/180px-Claude_Monet_1899_Nadar_crop.jpg</a></code></td></tr><tr><td>Width</td><td>2021px</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>2694px</td></tr><tr><td>Title</td><td>Claude Monet 1899 Nadar crop</td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Public domain</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
			
		</section>
	
		<section id="media-frame" class="section"><h1>Embeddable players</h1>
			
			<p>
				Embeddable players are best suited to situations where media files should
				not be downloaded by applications and end-users, but the playback capability
				may be provided in-line with other content by an application.
			</p>
			<p>
				With an embeddable player, although media assets themselves are published in
				some fashion, the resource described in accompanying metadata is a web page
				capable of playing them, typically via an <code class="tag">&lt;iframe&gt;</code>
				or equivalent, with the metadata including the preferred dimensions of the
				frame.
			</p>
			<p>
				This approach limits the capabilities which can be offered by the application
				to its users: as far as the application is concerned, the contents of the
				framed web page are completely opaque; it can only assume that the page
				will provide a suitable player for the media asset, and will have no
				control over playback.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use an embeddable player where:—
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
						Licensing only permits streaming of the asset, but
						<em>does</em> allow its presentation as part of a larger
						body of content (for example, within in a MOOC).
					</li>
				<li>
						Media is only available through a technology which
						may not be widely supported except through a custom player.
					</li>
				<li>
						Your media is published through a third party solution which does
						not provide ready access to direct media asset URLs.
					</li>
				<li>
						As a fall-back option alongside a direct media link (for example,
						to enable an application to generate the embeddable player code
						snippet for pasting into a MOOC or social network).
					</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For example:—</p>
			
			<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Property</th><th scope="col">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Media asset URL</td><td><code class="uri"><a href="//player.vimeo.com/video/110040373">//player.vimeo.com/video/110040373</a></code></td></tr><tr><td>MIME type</td><td><code class="constant">text/html</code></td></tr><tr><td>Embeddable?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Poster image URL</td><td><code class="uri"><a href="//i.vimeocdn.com/video/494149068_960.jpg">//i.vimeocdn.com/video/494149068_960.jpg</a></code></td></tr><tr><td>Preferred width</td><td>500px</td></tr><tr><td>Preferred height</td><td>281px</td></tr><tr><td>Title</td><td>Mount Piños Astrophotography Time Lapse</td></tr><tr><td>Duration</td><td>45s</td></tr><tr><td>License</td><td><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
			
		</section>
	
		<section id="media-page" class="section"><h1>Stand-alone playback pages</h1>
			
			<p>
				Stand-alone playback pages provide the least flexibility to
				applications, and—depending upon presentation—may result in reduced
				visibility of your media.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this strategy, an application is not able to embed your media
				at all, but instead must navigate to the page that you provide in
				a browser window. The application might provide a thumbnail or text
				link to your playback page, or it might choose to omit the media
				altogether if including it would result in a poor user experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use a stand-alone playback page where:—
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
						Licensing restrictions mean that you’re not able to authorise
						any kind of embedding.
					</li>
				<li>
						As a fall-back option alongside an embeddable player or direct
						media links (particularly if you already publish a playback page
						for each media asset).
					</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>For example:—</p>
			
			<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Property</th><th scope="col">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Media asset URL</td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0285z2y/horizon-19811982-the-race-to-ruin">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0285z2y/horizon-19811982-the-race-to-ruin</a></code></td></tr><tr><td>Title</td><td>Horizon: 1981-1982: The Race to Ruin</td></tr><tr><td>Embeddable?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Duration</td><td>48m52s</td></tr><tr><td>Geographical restriction</td><td>UK-only</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

	<section id="media-acl" class="section"><h1>Access control and media availability</h1>
		
		
		<p>
			A key aim of the Research &amp; Education Space is to increase the visibility of and access to
			digital media resources which are available to staff and students of
			educational establishments within the United Kingdom. While this naturally
			includes the wealth of resources which are openly-licensed and available to
			everybody, it also includes digital media which can <em>only</em>
			be accessed at scale by UK educational users.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to provide access to this material, publishers typically implement
			some kind of access control. While the platform itself is generally
			agnostic to media assets and their access-control mechanisms,
			applications require the ability to make user-interface decisions based upon
			the access restrictions imposed upon the media.
		</p>
		<p>
			For this reason, the Research &amp; Education Space defines three specific kinds of access-control mechanism,
			as well as a policy which conformant media must be published according to.
			Specifically, this policy is that media assets must:—
		</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
					Media must be available either freely or under the terms of a blanket
					or statutorily-backed licensing scheme available to educational
					establishments (or licenses may be obtained on their behalf by local
					authorities or central government).
				</li>
			<li>
					It must be possible to obtain the media without further subscription
					or other charges, however “value-added” services may be provided
					which offer additional capabilities (such as archiving, enhanced search),
					provided those services can be readily subscribed to at an establishment
					level.
				</li>
			<li>
					The media must be generally available on a long term basis. Media available
					only for short periods has limited value in education because it prevents
					the same resources being used again in the future.
				</li>
			<li>
					The technical access-control mechansims must be one or more of those
					described below.
				</li>
			<li>
					The nature of the access-control mechanism must be described in the
					metadata accompanying the media.
				</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
			For example, all of the following conform to the policy:—
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
					Media published via Wikimedia Commons is available to
					everybody on a permanent basis without any additional payment or subscritpion.
				</li>
			<li>
					Programmes which are part of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/collections">BBC
					Four Collections</a> are made available to everybody in the UK on a long-term basis
					(but may not be embedded). Access control is implemented through
					<a href="#media-geo">geo-blocking</a>.
				</li>
			<li>
					Recordings of broadcasts made according to the terms of <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/35">Section
					35 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (as amended)</a> is
					may be used by the institution who recorded it (or it was recorded on
					behalf of), provided their <a href="http://www.era.org.uk">ERA Licence</a>
					is maintained.
				</li>
			<li>
					Services which are authorised by ERA to maintain an archive of Section 35 recordings
					and make them available to ERA Licence-holders who pay a subscription fee, provided
					access is through a mechanism described below.
				</li>
			<li>
					A consortium of rights-holders who together define a scheme for access to one or
					more sets of media on an affordable establishment-level subscription basis, provided 
					access is through a mechanism described below.
				</li>
		</ul>

			see <cite><a href="#rights">Metadata describing rights and licensing</a></cite>
			and <cite><a href="#conditional-access">Describing conditionally-accessible resources</a></cite>.
		</p>
		
		<section id="media-geo" class="section"><h1>Geographical restrictions (geo-blocking)</h1>
			
			<p>
				Geo-blocking is the automatic determination of ability-to-access a resource
				by looking up the end-user’s public IP address against a database correlating
				IP address ranges with countries. For example, the address 132.185.240.10 is
				part of a range which is within the UK, whereas 192.0.32.8 is part of a range
				which is within the US.
			</p>
			<p>
				Geo-location databases and live services are available both for free and on
				commercial terms, with varying levels of quality and service assurance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Geo-blocking should generally be applied only where other access-control mechanisms are
				not applicable: for example, because a media asset is available to everybody
				within a particular country.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="media-saml" class="section"><h1>Federated access control using Shibboleth and the UK Access Management Federation</h1>
			
			<p>
				<a href="https://shibboleth.net">Shibboleth</a> is a federated authentication
				single sign-on mechanism which is widely used by providers of materials
				to provide access only to staff and students of educational establishments.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="http://www.ukfederation.org.uk">UK Access Management Federation</a>,
				operated by <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/janet">Janet</a>, provides the
				Shibboleth federation for UK institutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shibboleth-protected resources present a sign-in page to users who are not already
				authenticated, which makes it suitable for use with both the embeddable player and
				the stand-alone playback page publication approaches described above.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shibboleth-based access control is the preferred mechanism for use where media should be
				made available only to educational users.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="media-ipacl" class="section"><h1>IP-based access control</h1>
			
			
			<p>
				IP-based access control is often the simplest mechanism to implement, as it requires
				only for the publisher to check the end-user’s public IP address against a white-list
				and allow or permit access as required.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, creating and maintaining that white-list can involve significant administrative
				burden, particularly on a nation-wide basis, and it does not allow ready access to
				media to remote-working staff and students without their institution providing
				additional infrastructure such as remote-desktop services and VPNs.
			</p>
			<p>
				IP-based access control should generally be employed alongside Shibboleth-based
				authentication, and only for specific institutions which are not able to participate
				in the UK Acesss Management Federation.

			Linked Open Data in general, and the Research &amp; Education Space in particular, is at its most useful when the data describing things links to other data describing the same thing.
		</p>

		<p>
			In RDF, this is achieved using the <code class="literal">owl:sameAs</code> predicate. This predicate implies a direct equivalence relationship—in effect, it creates a synonym.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can use <code class="literal">owl:sameAs</code> whether or not the alternative identifiers use <code class="literal">http:</code> or <code class="literal">https:</code>, although the usefulness of URIs which aren't resolveable is limited.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, one might wish to specify that our book has an ISBN using the <code class="literal">urn:isbn:</code> URN scheme [<cite><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3187">RFC3187</a></cite>]:
		</p>

		<p>
			We can also indicate that the book described by our data refers to the same book at the British Library:
		</p>
	
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>&lt;/books/9781899066100#id&gt; owl:sameAs &lt;<a href="http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/011012558">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/011012558</a>&gt; .</code></pre>

				Take care when using <code class="literal">owl:sameAs</code> to ensure that the subject and the object really are directly equivalent.

			The data describing digital assets (including RDF representations themselves) must be made available under the terms of a <a href="#licenses">supported license</a> and include explicit licensing data in order for it to be indexed by the Research &amp; Education Space and be useable by applications. Our approach is aligned with the Open Data Institute’s <a href="http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary">guide to publishing machine-readable rights data</a>.
		</p>
		
		<section id="rights-rdf" class="section"><h1>Incorporating rights information into RDF data</h1>
			
			<p>
				In many cases, the simplest way of expressing rights information is to include it in the data that you're publishing, and this can often be accomplished by adding a single triple to each published resource:
			</p>
			<pre class="code turtle"><code>&lt;&gt; dct:license &lt;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&gt; .</code></pre>
			<p>
				This example assumes that you do not set <code class="literal">@base</code>, or if present, that you don't set it to be anything other than the document’s own URI. If you do, you will need to be more specific in the subject of your licensing triple.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is important that the subject of this triple is the URI of the <em>concrete document</em>. If you have different URIs for each RDF representation, and either send a <code class="literal">Content-Location</code> header or redirect to them, you need to ensure that the subject of the licensing triple is representation-specific URI (e.g., <code class="literal">/books/9781899066100.ttl</code>).
			</p>
			<p>
				This is because the Research &amp; Education Space crawler is <em>stateless</em>, just like the underlying HTTP protocol itself. In practice, this means that when a document is being processed by the crawler, the only information which can be used to evaluate it is the <var>request-URI</var>, the <code class="literal">Content-Location</code> (if provided), any <a href="#rights-link">Link headers</a> that were sent, and the serialised RDF itself.
			</p>
			<aside class="important">
				<p>
					Most importantly, you cannot assume when you construct your RDF that the crawler (or any other HTTP client) will be aware of any alternative URIs which redirect to
					your document (for example, via a <code class="literal">303 See Other</code> redirect), and so although you can include triples about those URIs in the document, they
					will have no role in determining whether the licensing is suitable for use in the Research &amp; Education Space.
				</p>
			</aside>
			<p>
				The Research &amp; Education Space crawler understands several common predicates for expressing the well-known URI of the license of a document:
			</p>
			<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Predicate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code class="literal"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/license">dct:license</a></code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="literal"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights">dct:rights</a></code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="literal"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/accessRights">dct:accessRights</a></code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="literal"><a href="http://creativecommons.org/ns#license">cc:license</a></code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="literal"><a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#license">xhtml:license</a></code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="literal"><a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#copyright">xhtml:copyright</a></code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
			<p>
				If you need to, you can provide more information than the license triple alone. For example, you might include a <em>request</em> which is not a formal requirement of the licensing terms, but you would like consumers to adhere to if possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				One way to do this is to include a <code class="literal">dct:license</code> triple referring to the well-known license URI, alongside a <code class="literal">dct:rights</code> triple pointing to a locally-defined <code class="literal">odrs:RightsStatement</code> entity (described using the <a href="http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/">Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary</a>).
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="rights-link" class="section"><h1>Expressing rights information using the Link HTTP header</h1>
			
			
			<p>
				It’s also possible to express licensing information using the <code class="literal"><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">Link</a></code> HTTP response header, instead of incorporating it into the data itself. While it will mean that it’s less obvious to somebody looking directly at your data what the licensing terms are, there may be less work involved in expressing the information this way, depending upon how your particular setup. 
			</p>
			<p>	
				To do so, simply send a <code class="literal">Link</code> header pointing to one of the <a href="#licenses">well-known license URIs</a> listed below and <code class="literal">rel="license"</code>.
			</p>
			<pre class="code"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Link: &lt;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&gt;;rel="license"</code></pre>
			<aside class="info">
				<p>The Research &amp; Education Space crawler translates <code class="literal">Link</code> headers into RDF triples while evaluating resources it has retrieved. Unless the header specifies otherwise, the subject is the URI considered to be that of the document (which is the <code class="literal">Content-Location</code> if specified, or the <var>request-URI</var> otherwise), the predicate is the <code class="literal">rel</code> value interpreted as a URI against a base of <code class="uri">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#</code> (in other words, <code class="literal">license</code> is interpreted as <code class="uri">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#license</code>, while a fully-qualified URI will be used as-is), and the object is the link <em>target</em> (in the example above, <code class="uri">http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</code>).</p>

					The Apache web server can be configured to send a <code class="literal">Link</code> header containing licensing information using <code class="literal"><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html">mod_headers</a></code>. Once the module has been enabled, you can use a configuration stanza similar to:—
				</p>
				<pre class="output"><samp>Header append Link "&lt;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&gt;;rel=\"license\""</samp></pre>

			Many kinds of digital asset are not available to the general public but may
			be accessed by the RES audience: students and teachers affiliated with a
			recognised educational institution in the UK. This may be because specific
			exceptions in law allow access when it would not otherwise be possible, or
			because the rights-holder has elected to make the assets available only to
			those in education.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to support this, and ensure that users of RES applications are able to
			use to the greatest range of material that they legitimately have access to,
			the metadata describing those assets which aren’t available to the public but
			are to educational users must describe means by which they are accessed.
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				A given asset may be available from multiple sources, each with its own
				specific constraints applied to who may access it. For example, a recording
				of a radio programme might be held on behalf of educational users by two
				separate online services, both requiring that the affiliated institution
				be a licensee of the relevant <a href="http://www.era.org.uk">ERA licensing scheme</a>,
				and both operating their own institutional-level subscription schemes. To be most
				useful, the RES index must aggregate the metadata describing <em>both</em>
				means of access, and the metadata must convey sufficient information so as
				to allow applications to decide which, if any, should be presented to the
				end-user.

			Describing your media assets (or, in the case of embeddable players,

		own description separate to any <a href="#assets">digital
		assets</a> which are <em>manifestations</em> of
		creative works. It’s not uncommon for there to be multiple
		digital manifestations hosted by different organisations of the same
		creative work.
