		The <i class="firstterm">Research &amp; Education Space</i> (RES) is a project being jointly delivered by <a href="http://jisc.ac.uk">Jisc</a>, the <a href="http://bufvc.ac.uk">British Universities Film &amp; Video Council</a> (BUFVC), and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>. Its aim is to bring as much as possible of the UK’s publicly-held archives, and more besides, to learners and teachers across the UK.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the heart of RES is <i class="firstterm">Acropolis</i>, a technical platform which will collect, index and organise rich structured data about those archive collections published as <i class="firstterm">Linked Open Data</i> (LOD) on the Web. The collected data is organised around the people, places, events, concepts and things related to the items in the archive collections—and, if the archive assets themselves are available in digital form, that data includes the information on how to access them, all in a consistent machine-readable form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Building on the Acropolis platform, applications can make use of this index, along with the source data itself, in order to make those collections accessible and meaningful.
	</p>
	<p>
		This book describes how a collection-holder can publish their data in a form which can be collected and indexed by Acropolis and used by applications, and how an application developer can make use of the index and interpret the source data in order to present it to end-users in a useful fashion.

	<section id="intro" class="chapter"><h1>An introduction to the Acropolis platform</h1>
	
	<p>
		The Acropolis platform is made of up three main components: a specialised web crawler, <i class="firstterm">Anansi</i>, an <i class="firstterm">aggregator</i>, <i class="firstterm">Spindle</i>, and a public API layer, <i class="firstterm">Quilt</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anansi’s role is to crawl the web, retrieving <a href="#licenses">permissively-licensed</a> <a href="#lod">Linked Open Data</a>, and passing it to the aggregator for processing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Spindle examines the data, looking for instances where the same digital, physical or conceptual entity is described in more than one place, primarily where the data <a href="#sameas">explicitly states the equivalence</a>, and aggregates and stores that information in an index.
	</p>
	<p>
		This <i class="firstterm">subject-oriented</i> index is the very heart of RES: by re-arranging published data so that it's organised around the entities described by it, instead of by publisher or data-set, applications are able to rapidly locate all of the information known about a particular entity because it’s collected together in one place.
	</p>
	<p>
		Quilt is responsible for making the index available to applications, also by publishing it as Linked Open Data. Because RES maintains an <em>index</em>, rather than a complete copy of all data that it finds, applications must consume data both from the RES index and from the original data sources—and consequentially Quilt itself also conforms to the publishing recommendations in this book.
	</p>
	<p>
		The RES project will not be directly developing end-user applications, although sample code and demonstrations will be published to assist software developers in doing so. RES only indexes and publishes data released under terms which permit re-use in both commercial and non-commercial settings.
	</p>
	<p>
		For RES to be most useful, holders of publicly-funded archive collections across the UK need to publish Linked Open Data describing their collections (including digital assets, where they exist). Although many collections are already doing so or plan to, the RES project partners will be providing tools and advice to collection-holders in order to assist them throughout the lifetime of the project.
	</p>

	<section id="lod" class="chapter"><h1>Linked Open Data: What is it, and how does it work?</h1>
	
	
	<p>
		Linked Open Data is a mechanism for publishing structured data on the Web about virtually anything, in a form which can be consistently retrieved and processed by software. The result is a world wide web of data which works in parallel to the web of documents our browsers usually access, transparently using the same protocols and infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where the ordinary web of documents is a means of publishing a page about something intended for a human being to understand, this web of data is a means of publishing data about those things.
	</p>
		
	<section id="uris" class="section"><h1>Web addresses, URLs and URIs</h1>
		
		<p>
			<i class="firstterm">Uniform Resource Locators</i> (URLs), often known as <i class="firstterm">Web addresses</i>, are a way of unambiguously identifying something which is published electronically. Although there are a variety of kinds of URL, most that you day-to-day see begin with <code class="literal">http</code> or <code class="literal">https</code>: this is known as the <i class="firstterm">scheme</i>, and defines how the rest of the URL is structured—although most kinds of URL follow a common structure.
		</p>
		<p>
			The scheme also indicates the communications protocol which should be used to access the resource identified by the URL: if it's <code class="literal">http</code>, then the resource is accessible using HTTP—the protocol used by web servers and browsers; if it's <code class="literal">https</code>, then it’s accessible using secure HTTP (i.e., HTTP with added encryption).
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				The act of accessing the resource identified by a URL is known as <i class="firstterm">resolving</i> it.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			Following the scheme in a URL is the <i class="firstterm">authority</i>—the domain name of the web site: it’s called the authority because it identifies the entity responsible for defining the meaning and structure of the remainder of the URL. If the URL begins with <code class="uri">http://www.bbc.co.uk/</code>, you know that it's defined and managed by the BBC; if it begins with <code class="uri">http://www.bfi.org.uk/</code>, you know that it's managed by the BFI, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the authority is an optional <i class="firstterm">path</i> (i.e., the location of the document within the context of the particular domain name or authority), and optional <i class="firstterm">query parameters</i> (beginning with a question-mark), and <i class="firstterm">fragment</i> (beginning with a hash-mark).
		</p>
		<p>
			URLs serve a dual purpose: not only do they provide a name for something, but they also provide anything which understands them with the information they need to retrieve it. Provided your application is able to speak the HTTP protocol, it should in principle be able to retrieve anything using a <code class="literal">http</code> URL.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i class="firstterm">Universal Resource Indicators</i> (URIs) are a superset of URLs, and are in effect a kind of <i class="firstterm">universal identifier</i>: their purpose is to name something, without <em>necessarily</em> indicating how to retrieve it. In fact, it may be that the thing named using a URI cannot possibly be retrieved using a piece of software and an Internet connection because it refers to an abstract concept or a physical object.
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>In other words, while URLs are used specifically to identify digital resources which can be retrieved from a Web server, URIs can be used to identify anything: the URLs we use in our browsers are all URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			URIs follow the same structure as URLs, in that there is a scheme defining how the remainder is structured, and usually some kind of authority, but there are many different schemes, and many of them do not have any particular mechanism defined for how you might retrieve something named using that scheme.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, the <code class="literal"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4151">tag:</a></code> URI scheme provides a means for anybody to define a name for something in the form of a URI, using a domain name that they control as an authority, but without indicating any particular semantics about the thing being named.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, URIs which begin with <code class="literal">urn:</code> are actually part of one of a number of <em>sub-schemes</em>, many of which exist as a means of writing down some existing identifier about something in the form of a URI. For example, an <abbr title="International Standard Book Number">ISBN</abbr> can be written as a URI by prefixing it with <code class="literal">urn:isbn:</code> (for example, <code class="uri">urn:isbn:9781899066100</code>).
		</p>
		<p>
			You might be forgiven for wondering why somebody might want to write an ISBN in the form of a URI, but in fact there are a few reasons. In most systems, ISBNs are effectively opaque alphanumeric strings: although there is usually some validation of the check digit upon data entry, once stored in a database, they are rarely interrogated for any particular meaning. Given this, ISBNs work perfectly well for identifying books for which ISBNs have been issued—but what if you want to store data about other kinds of things, too? Recognising that this was a particular need for retailers, a few years ago ISBNs were made into a subset of <i class="firstterm">Global Trade Information Numbers</i> (GTINs), the system used for barcoding products sold in shops.
		</p>
		<p>
			By unifying ISBNs and GTINs, retailers were able to use the same field in their database systems for any type of product being sold, whether it was a book with an ISBN, or some other kind of product with a GTIN. All the while, the identifier remained essentially opaque: provided the string of digits and letters scanned by the bar-code reader could be matched to a row in a database, it doesn't matter precisely what those letters and numbers actually are.
		</p>
		<p>
			Representing identifiers in the form of URIs can be thought of as another level of generalisation: it allows the development of systems where the underlying database doesn’t need to know nor care about the <em>kind</em> of identifier being stored, and so can store information about absolutely anything which can be identified by a URI. In many cases, this doesn’t represent a huge technological shift—those database systems already pay little attention to the structure of the identifier itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hand-in-hand with this generalisation effect is the ability to disambiguate and harmonise without needing to coordinate a variety of different standards bodies across the world. Whereas the integration of ISBNs and GTINs took a particular concerted effort in order to achieve, the integration of ISBNs and URNs was only a matter of defining the URN scheme, because URIs are already designed to be open-ended and extensible.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i class="firstterm">Linked Open Data URIs</i> are a subset of URIs which, again, begin with <code class="literal">http:</code> or <code class="literal">https:</code>, but do not necessarily name something which can be retrieved from a web server. Instead, they are URIs where performing resolution results in machine-readable data <em>about</em> the entity being identified.
		</p>
		<p>
			In summary:

	</section>
	
	<section id="triples" class="section"><h1>Describing things with triples</h1>
		
		<p>
			Linked Open Data uses the <i class="firstterm">Resource Description Framework</i> (RDF) to convey information about things. RDF is an open-ended system for modelling information about things, which it does by breaking it down into statements (or <i class="firstterm">assertions</i>), each of which consists of a <i class="firstterm">subject</i>, a <i class="firstterm">predicate</i> and an <i class="firstterm">object</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The subject is the thing being described; the predicate is the aspect or attribute of the subject being described; and the object is the description of that particular attribute.
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				If you are familiar with object-oriented programming, you may find it useful to think of a subject as being an <em>instance</em>, a predicate as a <em>property</em>, and an object as a <em>value</em>. In fact, the terms are often used interchangeably.
			</p>
		</aside>
	
		<p>
			For example, you might want to state that the book with the ISBN 978-1899066100 has the title <cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite>. You can break this assertion down into its subject, predicate, and object:
		</p>
	
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ISBN 978-1899066100</td><td>Has the title</td><td><cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
	
		<p>
			Together, this statement made up of a subject, predicate and object is called a <i class="firstterm">triple</i> (because there are three components to it), while a collection of statements is called a <i class="firstterm">graph</i>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			In RDF, the subject and the predicate are expressed as URIs this helps to remove ambiguity and the risk of clashes so that the data can be published and consumed in the same way regardless of where it comes from or who’s processing it. Objects <em>can</em> be expressed as URIs where you want to assert some kind of reference to something else, but can also be <i class="firstterm">literals</i> (such as text, numeric values, dates, and so on).
		</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id="predicates-vocabs" class="section"><h1>Predicates and vocabularies</h1>
		
		<p>
			RDF doesn’t specify the meaning of most predicates itself: in other words, RDF doesn’t tell you what URI you should use to indicate “has the title”. Instead, because anybody can create a URI, it’s entirely up to you whether you invent your own vocabulary when you publish your data, or adopt somebody else’s. Generally, of course, if you want other people to be able to understand your data, it’s probably a good idea to adopt existing vocabularies where they exist.
		</p>
		<p>
			In essence, RDF provides the grammar, while community consensus provides the dictionary.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most commonly-used general-purpose vocabularies is the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms</a>, managed by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), and which includes a suitable title predicate:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ISBN 978-1899066100</td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title ">http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</a></code></td><td><cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		<p>
			With this triple, a consuming application that understands the DCMI Metadata Terms vocabulary can process that data and understand the predicate to indicate that the item has the title <cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite>.
		</p>
		<aside class="info">
			<p>
				The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative and the core of the DCMI Metadata Terms vocabulary pre-date RDF and Linked Open Data by some years: older vocabularies and classification schemes have been routinely adapted and re-purposed for RDF as it’s become more widely used as an approach to representing structured data.
			</p>
		</aside>
		
		<p>
			Because <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title ">http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</a></code> is quite long-winded, it’s common to write predicate URIs in a compressed form, consisting of a namespace prefix and local name—similar to the <code class="literal">xmlns</code> mechanism used in XML documents.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Because people will often use the same prefix to refer to the same namespace URI, it is not unusual to see this short form of URIs used in books and web pages. Some common prefixes and namespace URIs are shown below:
		</p>
		
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Vocabulary</th><th scope="col">Namespace URI</th><th scope="col">Often abbreviated as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/">RDF Syntax</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">rdf:</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PER-rdf-schema-20140109/">RDF Schema</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#">http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">rdfs:</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">foaf:</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://vocab.deri.ie/void">Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)</a></td><td><code class="uri"><a href="http://rdfs.org/ns/void#">http://rdfs.org/ns/void#</a></code></td><td><code class="literal">void:</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		
		<p>
			For example, defining the namespace prefix <code class="literal">dct</code> with a namespace URI of <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/    ">http://purl.org/dc/terms/</a></code>, we can write our predicate as <code class="literal">dct:title</code> instead of <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title">http://purl.org/dc/terms/title</a></code>.
			RDF systems re-compose the complete URI by concatenating the prefix URI and the local name.

	<section id="subject-uris" class="section"><h1>Subject URIs</h1>
		
		<p>
			In RDF, subjects are also URIs. While in RDF itself there are no particular restrictions upon the kind of URIs you can use (and there are a great many different kinds — those beginning <code class="literal">http:</code> and <code class="literal">https:</code> that you see on the Web are just two of hundreds), Linked Open Data places some restrictions on subject URIs in order to function. These are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Subject URIs must begin with <code class="literal">http:</code> or <code class="literal">https:</code>.</li>
			<li>They must be unique: although you can have multiple URIs for the same thing, one URI can’t refer to multiple distinct things at once.</li>
			<li>If a Linked Open Data consumer makes an HTTP request for the subject URI, the server should send back RDF data describing that subject.</li>
			<li>As with URLs, subject URIs need to be persistent: that is, they should change as little as possible, and where they do change, you need to be able to make arrangements for requests for the old URI to be forwarded to the new one.
				</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			In practice, this means that when you decide upon a subject URI, it needs to be within a domain name that you control and can operate a web server for; you need to have a scheme for your subject URIs which distinguishes between things which are represented digitally (and so have ordinary URLs) and things which cannot; you also need to arrange for your web server to actually serve RDF when it’s requested; and finally you need to decide a form for your subject URIs which minimises changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			This may sound daunting, but it can be quite straightforward—and shares much in common with deciding upon a URL structure for a website that is intended only for ordinary browsers.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, if you are the <i class="firstterm">Intergalactic Alliance Library &amp; Museum</i>, whose domain name is <code class="literal">ialm.int</code>, you might decide that all of your books’ URIs will begin with <code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/</code>, and use the full 13-digit ISBN, without dashes, as the key. You could pick something other than the ISBN, such as an identifier meaningful only to your own internal systems, but it makes developers’ lives easier if you incorporate well-known identifiers where it’s not problematic to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because this web of data co-exists with the web of documents, begin by defining the URL to the <em>document</em> about this book:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>

		<p>
			Anybody visiting that URL in their browser will be provided with information about the book in your collection. Because the URL incorporates a well-known identifier, the ISBN, if any other pieces of information about the book change or are corrected, that URL remains stable. As a bonus, incorporating the ISBN means that the URL to the document is predictable.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="info">
			<p>
				Of course, the ISBN may have been entered incorrectly (or may be cancelled by the registration authority), and it would be worth planning for that eventuality—but assuming that your collection website’s data is based upon information that is used operationally day-to-day, the risk of that needing to occur is kept to a minimum.
			</p>

		<p>
			Having defined the URL for book pages, it’s now time to define the rest of the structure. The Intergalactic Alliance Library &amp; Museum web server will be configured to serve web pages to web browsers, and RDF data to RDF consumers: that is, there are multiple representations of the same data. It’s useful, from time to time, to be able to refer to each of these representations with a distinct URL. Let’s say, then, that we’ll use the general form:
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.EXT</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
			
		<p>
			In this case, <code class="literal">EXT</code> refers to the well-known <i class="firstterm">filename extension</i> for the particular type of representation we’re referring to.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				Media types (sometimes also called MIME types or content types) are registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The registration document includes the preferred or commonly-used filename extensions for that type. For example, the registration document for HTML can be found <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/html">on the IANA website</a>.
			</p>
		</aside>
		
		<p>
			Therefore, the HTML web page for our book will have the <i class="firstterm">representation-specific</i> URL of:
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.html</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>

		<p>
			If you also published CSV data for your book, it could be given the representation-specific URL of:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.csv</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
		
		<p>
			RDF can be expressed in a number of different forms, or serialisations. The most commonly-used serialisation is called <i class="firstterm">Turtle</i>, and typically has the filename extension of <code class="literal">ttl</code>. Therefore our Turtle serialisation would have the representation-specific URL of:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.ttl</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
		
		<p>
			Now that we have defined the structure of our URLs, we can define the pattern used for the subject URIs themselves. Remember that the URI needs to be <i class="firstterm">dereferenceable</i>—that is, when a consuming application makes a request for it, the server can respond with the appropriate representation.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to do this, there are two options: we can use a special kind of redirect, or we can use fragments.  The fragment approach works best where you have a document for each individual item, as we do here, and takes advantage of the fact that in the HTTP protocol, any part of a URL following the “#” symbol is never sent to the server.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, let’s say that we’ll distinguish our URLs from our subject URIs by suffixing the subject URIs with <code class="literal">#id</code>. The URI for our book therefore becomes:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
		
		<p>
			When an application requests the information about this book, by the time it arrives at our web server, it’s been turned into a request for the very first URL we defined—the generic “document about this book” URL:
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100</code></p>
		<footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
		
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				The reason the “fragment” portion of the URI is stripped off the request by the time it arrives at the web server is because the HTTP protocol states that fragments are never sent <i class="firstterm">over the wire</i>—that is, they are not included in the protocol exchange between the client and the server. Their original use was to identify a section within a web page and allow a browser to skip straight to it even though it requested and was served the whole page. Fragments in <em>URLs</em> are regularly used for this purpose today.
			</p>
		</aside>
		
		<p>
			When an application understands RDF and tells the server as much as part of the request, the server can send back the Turtle representation instead of an HTML web page—a part of the HTTP protocol known as <i class="firstterm">content negotiation</i>. Content negotiation allows a server to pick the most appropriate representation for something (where it has multiple representations), based upon the client’s preferences.
		</p>
		<p>
			With our subject URI pattern defined, we can revisit our original assertion:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:title</code></td><td><cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		
	</section>
	
	<section id="classes" class="section"><h1>Defining what something is: classes</h1>
		
		<p>
			One of the few parts of the common vocabulary which is defined by RDF itself is the predicate <code class="literal">rdf:type</code>, which specifies the class (or classes) of a subject. Like predicates, classes are defined by vocabularies, and are also expressed as URIs. The classes of a subject are intended to convey what that subject <em>is</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, the Bibliographic Ontology, whose namespace URI is <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/">http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/</a></code> (commonly prefixed as <code class="literal">bibo:</code>) defines a class named <code class="literal">bibo:Book</code> (whose full URI we can deduce as being <code class="uri"><a href="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Book">http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Book</a></code>).
		</p>
		<p>
			If we write a triple which asserts that our book is a <code class="literal">bibo:Book</code>, any consumers which understand the Bibliographic Ontology can interpret our data as referring to a book:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></td><td><code class="literal">rdf:type</code></td><td><code class="literal">bibo:Book</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:title</code></td><td><cite>Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging</cite></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		
	</section>
	
	<section id="describing" class="section"><h1>Describing things defined by other people</h1>
		
		
		<p>
			There is no technical reason why your subject URIs must <em>only</em> be URIs that you control directly. In Linked Open Data, the matter of <em>trust</em> is a matter for the data consumer: one application might have a white-list of trusted sources, another might have a black-list of sources known to be problematic, another might have more complex heuristics, while another might use your social network such that assertions from your friends are considered more likely to be trustworthy than those from other people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Describing subjects defined by other people has a practical purpose. Predicates work in a particular direction, and although sometimes vocabularies will define pairs of predicates so that you can make a statement either way around, interpreting this begins to get complicated, and so most vocabularies define predicates only in one direction.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an example, you might wish to state that a book held in a library is about a subject that you’re describing. On a web page, you’d simply write this down and link to it—perhaps as part of a “Useful resources” section. In Linked Open Data, you can make the assertion that one of the subjects of the other library’s book is the one you’re describing. This works exactly the same way as if you were describing something that you’d defined yourself—you simply write the statement, but somebody else’s URI as the subject.
		</p>
		<p>
			This can also be used to make life easier for developers and reduce network overhead of applications. In your “Useful resources” section, you probably wouldn’t only list the URL to the page about the book: instead, you’d list the title and perhaps the author <em>as well</em> as linking to the page about the book. You can do that in Linked Open Data, too. Let’s say that we’re expressing the data about a subject—Roman Gaul—which we’ve assigned a URI of <code class="uri">http://ialm.int/things/2068003#id</code>:
		</p>
		<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Predicate</th><th scope="col">Object</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/things/2068003#id</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:title</code></td><td><cite>Roman Gaul</cite></td></tr><tr><td><code class="uri">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/006889069</code></td><td><code class="literal">rdf:type</code></td><td><code class="literal">bibo:Book</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="uri">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/006889069</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:title</code></td><td><cite>Asterix the Gaul</cite></td></tr><tr><td><code class="uri">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/006889069</code></td><td><code class="literal">dct:subject</code></td><td><code class="uri">http://ialm.int/things/2068003#id</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
		<p>
			In this example we’ve defined a subject, called <cite>Roman Gaul</cite>, of which we’ve provided very little detail, except to say that it’s a subject of the book <cite>Asterix the Gaul</cite>, whose identifier is defined by the British Library.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that we haven‘t described the book <cite>Asterix the Gaul</cite> in full: RDF operates on an <i class="firstterm">open world principle</i>, which means that sets of assertions are generally interpreted as being incomplete—or rather, only as complete as they need to be. The fact that we haven’t specified an author or publisher of the book doesn’t mean there isn’t one, just that the data isn’t present here; where in RDF you need to state explicitly that something doesn’t exist, there is usually a particular way to do that.
		</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id="turtle" class="section"><h1>Turtle: the terse triple language</h1>
		
		<p>
			<i class="firstterm">Turtle</i> is one of the most common languages for writing RDF in use today—although there are many others. Turtle is intended to be interpreted and generated by machines first and foremost, but also be readable and writeable by human beings (albeit usually software developers).
		</p>
		<p>
			In its simplest form, we can just write out our statements, one by one, each separated by a full stop. URIs are written between angle-brackets (<code class="literal">&lt;</code> and <code class="literal">&gt;</code>), while <i class="firstterm">string literals</i> (such as the names of things) are written between double-quotation marks (<code class="literal">"</code>).
		</p>
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Book&gt; .
	
&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/title&gt; "Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging" .</code></pre>
		<p>
			This is quite long-winded, but fortunately Turtle allows us to define and use prefixes just as we have in this book. When we write the short form of a URI, it’s <em>not</em> written between angle-brackets:
		</p>
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix bibo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/&gt; .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; rdf:type bibo:Book .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; dct:title "Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging" .</code></pre>
		<p>
			Because Turtle is designed for RDF, and <code class="literal">rdf:type</code> is defined by RDF itself, Turtle
			provides a nice shorthand for the predicate: <code class="literal">a</code>. We can simply say that our book is <code class="literal">a bibo:Book</code>:
		</p>
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix bibo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/&gt; .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; a bibo:Book .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; dct:title "Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging" .</code></pre>
		<p>
			Writing the triples out this way quickly gets repetitive: you don’t want to be writing the subject URI every time, especially not if writing Turtle by hand. If you end a statement with a semi-colon instead of a full-stop, it indicates that what follows is another predicate and object about the same subject:
		</p>
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix bibo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/&gt; .

&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt;
	a bibo:Book ;
	dct:title "Acronyms and Synonyms in Medical Imaging" .</code></pre>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				If you end a statement with a comma instead of a semi-colon or full-stop, it means that what follows is another object with the same subject and predicate—in other words, it’s a quick way of writing multiple values.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			Turtle includes a number of capabilities which we haven’t yet discussed here, but are important for
			fully understanding real-world RDF in general and Turtle documents in particular. These include:
		</p>
		<dl>
				<dt>Typed literals</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						<i class="firstterm">Typed literals</i>: literals which aren’t simply strings of text, but can be of any one of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">XML Schema data types</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						 Literal types are indicated by writing the literal value, followed by two carets, and then the datatype URI: for example, <code class="literal">"2013-01-26"^^xsd:date</code>.					
					</p>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Blank nodes</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Blank nodes are entities for which some information is provided, but where the subject
						URI is not known. There are two different ways of using blank nodes in Turtle: a blank node <em>value</em> is one where in place of a URI or a literal value, an entity is partially described.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another way of using blank nodes is to assign it a private, transient identifier (a blank node identifier), and then use that identifier where you’d normally use a URI as a subject or object. The transient identifier has no meaning outside of the context of the document: it’s simply a way of referring to the same (essentially anonymous) entity in multiple places within the document.
					</p>
					<p>
						A blank node value is expressed by writing an opening square bracket, followed by the sets of predicates and values for the blank node, followed by a closing square bracket. For example, we can state that an author of the book is a nondescript entity who we know is a person named <code class="literal">Nicola Strickland</code>, but for whom we don’t have an identifier:
					</p>
					<pre class="code turtle"><code>&lt;http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id&gt; dct:creator [
	a foaf:Person ;
	foaf:name "Nicola Strickland" 
] .</code></pre>
					<p>
						Blank node identifiers are written similarly to the compressed form of URIs, except that an underscore is used as the prefix. For example, <code class="literal">_:johnsmith</code>. You don’t have to do anything special to create a blank node identifier (simply use it), and the actual name you assign has no meaning outside of the context of the document—if you replace all instances of <code class="literal">_:johnsmith</code> with <code class="literal">_:zebra</code>, the actual meaning of the document is unchanged—although it may be slightly more confusing to read and write as a human.
					</p>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Multi-lingual string literals</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String literals in the examples given so far are written in no particular language (which may be appropriate in some cases, particularly when expressing people’s names).
					</p>
					<p>
						The language used for a string literal is indicated by writing the literal value, followed by an at-sign, and then the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1 language code</a>, or an ISO 639-1 language code, followed by a hyphen, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example: <code class="literal">"Intergalatic Alliance Library &amp; Museum Homepage"@en</code>, or <code class="literal">"grey"@en-gb</code>.
					</p>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Base URIs</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						By default, the base URI for the terms in a Turtle document is the URI it’s being served from. Occasionally, it can be useful to specify an alternative base URI. To do this, an <code class="literal">@base</code> statement can be included (in a similar fashion to <code class="literal">@prefix</code>).
					</p>
					<p>For example, if a document specifies <code class="literal">@base &lt;http://www.example.com/things/&gt; .</code>, then the URI <code class="literal">&lt;12447652#id&gt;</code> within that document can be expanded to <code class="literal">&lt;http://www.example.com/things/12447652#id&gt;</code>, while the URI <code class="literal">&lt;/artefacts/47fb01&gt;</code> would be expanded to <code class="literal">&lt;http://www.example.com/artefacts/47fb01&gt;</code>.</p>

			In this example, we are still describing our book, but we specify that the title is in English (though don’t indicate any particular national variant of English); we state that it was issued (published) in the year 1997, and that it’s publisher—for whom we don’t have an identifier—is an organisation whose name is <cite>CRC Press</cite>.
		</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id="quads" class="section"><h1>From three to four: relaying provenance with quads</h1>
		
		<p>
			While triples are a perfectly servicable mechanism for describing something, they don’t have the ability
			to tell you where data is <em>from</em> (unless you impose a restriction that you only deal
			with data where the domain of the subject URI matches that of the server you’re retrieving from). In some
			systems, including Acropolis, this limitation is overcome by introducing another element: a graph URI, identifying the <em>source</em> of a triple. Thus, instead of triples, RES actually stores <i class="firstterm">quads</i>.			
		</p>
		<p>
			When we assign an explicit URI to a graph in this way, it becomes known as a <i class="firstterm">named graph</i>—that is, a graph with an explicit identifier (name) assigned to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Turtle itself doesn’t have a concept of named graphs, but there is an extension to Turtle, named
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-trig-20140225/">TriG</a>, which includes the
			capability to specify the URI of a named graph containing a particular set of triples.
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				While Quilt will serve RDF/XML and Turtle when requested, it will also serve TriG: this allows
				applications to determine the provenance of statements stored in the RES index, allowing
				them to white– or black-list data sources if needed.
			</p>
		</aside>		
	</section>

	<section id="why-rdf" class="section"><h1>Why does RES use RDF?</h1>
		
		<p>
			RDF isn’t necessarily the simplest way of expressing some data about something, and that means it’s often not the first choice for publishers and consumers. Often, an application consuming some data is designed specifically for one particular dataset, and so its interactions are essentially bespoke and comparatively easy to define.  
		</p>
		<p>
			RES, by nature, brings together a large number of different structured datasets, describing lots of different kinds of things, with a need for a wide range of applications to be able to work with those sets in a consistent fashion.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the time of writing (ten years after its introduction), RDF’s use of URIs as identifiers, common vocabularies and data types, inherent flexibility and well-defined structure means that is the only option for achieving this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether you’re describing an audio clip or the year 1987, a printed book or the concept of a documentary film, RDF provides the ability to express the data you hold in intricate detail, without being beholden to a single central authority to validate the modelling work undertaken by experts in your field.
		</p>
		<p>
			For application developers, the separation of grammar and vocabularies means that applications can interpret data in as much or as little detail as is useful for the end-users. For instance, you might develop an application which understands a small set of general-purpose metadata terms but which can be used with virtually everything surfaced through RES.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, you might develop a specialist application which interprets rich descriptions in a particular domain in order to target specific use-cases. In either case, you don’t need to know who the data comes from, only sufficient understanding of the vocabularies in use to satisfy your needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, because we recognise that publishing and consuming Linked Open Data as an individual publisher or application developer may be unfamiliar territory, and so throughout the lifetime of the project we are committed to publishing documentation, developing tools and operating workshops in order to help developers and publishers work with RDF in general and RES in particular more easily.

</section>
	<section id="publishers" class="chapter"><h1>Requirements for publishers</h1>
	
	
	<p>
		Publishers wishing to make their data visible in the Acropolis index and useable by RES applications must conform to a small set of basic requirements. These are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The data must be expressed as RDF and published as Linked Open Data;</li>
		<li>the data must be licensed under permissive terms (in particular, it must allow re-use in both	commercial and non-commercial applications);</li>
		<li>the licensing terms must be included in the data itself so that consumers can perform automated due diligence before using it;</li>
		<li>the data should use the vocabularies described in this book for best results (although you are free to use other vocabularies too).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Although RES requires that you publish Linked Open Data, that doesn’t mean you can’t also publish your data in other ways. While human-facing HTML pages are the obvious example, there’s nothing about publishing Linked Open Data which means you can’t also publish JSON with a bespoke schema, CSV, OpenOffice.org spreadsheets, or operate complex query APIs requiring registration to use.
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact, best practice generally is that you publish in as many formats as you’re generally able to, and do so in a consistent fashion. And, while your “data views” (that is, the structured machine-readable representations of your data about things) are going to be very dull and uninteresting to most human beings, that doesn’t mean that you can’t serve nicely-designed web pages about them as the serialisation for ordinary web browsers.

				Turtle is increasingly the most common RDF serialisation in circulation and is very widely-supported by processing tools and libraries.
			</p>
			<p>
				RDF/XML is an older serialisation which is slightly more well-supported than Turtle. RDF/XML is often more verbose than the equivalent Turtle expression of a graph, but as an XML-based format can be generated automatically from other kinds of XML using XSLT.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are considering publishing your data as JSON, you may consider publishing it as <a href="http://json-ld.org">JSON-LD</a>, a serialisation of RDF which is intended to be useful to consumers which don’t understand RDF specifically. JSON-LD isn’t currently supported by RES, but may be in the future.

		<section id="self-describing-documents" class="section"><h1>Describe the document and serialisations as well as the item</h1>

			<div class="table"><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Subject</th><th scope="col">Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Document URL</td><td><code class="literal">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100</code></td></tr><tr><td>Representation URL</td><td><code class="literal">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100.ttl</code></td></tr><tr><td>Item URI</td><td><code class="literal">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
			<p>
				It is recommended that publishers describe any other serialisations which they are making available as well, but it is not currently a requirement to do so.

		<section id="link-alternate" class="section"><h1>Link to the RDF representations from the HTML variant</h1>
					
			<p>
				In your HTML representations, use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element (within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element) with a <code class="literal">rel</code> attribute of <code class="literal">"alternate"</code> in order to link to the other representations of the same document:
			</p>
			<pre class="code html"><code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rdf+xml" href="/books/9781899066100.rdf"&gt;
&lt;link rel="alternate" type="text/turtle" href="/books/9781899066100.ttl"&gt;</code></pre>
			<p>
				While it’s less efficient than content negotiation (see below) for both consuming applications and for your server to access your alternative serialisations this way, linking to them from your HTML provides a useful fall-back capability in the event that content negotiation fails or has to be disabled—for example, if you need to switch your website to be served from a content delivery network which doesn’t support negotiation.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s not the preferred option because consumers must first obtain the HTML, parse it, and then request the RDF. Often, generating the HTML page will also be more expensive than generating the equivalent RDF serialisations.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="perform-conneg" class="section"><h1>Perform content negotiation when requests are received for item URIs</h1>
			
			<p>
				If you use fragment-based URIs, this means that your web server must be configured to perform content negotiation on requests received for the portion of the URI before the hash (<code class="literal">#</code>) sign.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if your subject URIs are in the form:
			</p>
			<blockquote><p><code class="literal">http://ialm.int/books/9781899066100#id</code></p><footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
			<p>
				Then when your server receives requests for the document:
			</p>
			<blockquote><p><code class="literal">/books/9781899066100</code></p><footer><cite/></footer></blockquote>
			<p>
				It should perform content negotiation and return an appropriate media type, including the supported RDF serialisations if requested.
			</p>
			<p>
				When sending a response, the server <strong class="strong">must</strong> send an appropriate <code class="literal">Vary</code> header, and should send a <code class="literal">Content-Location</code> header referring to the representation being served. For example:
			</p>
			<pre class="code"><code>HTTP/1.0 OK
Server: Apache/2.2 (Unix)
Vary: Accept
Content-Type: text/turtle; charset=utf-8
Content-Location: /books/9781899066100.ttl
Content-Length: 272
…</code></pre>
			<aside class="tip">
				<p>The Apache web server automatically sends the correct headers when configured to perform Content Negotiation on a set of static files. See the Apache <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_negotiation.html">mod_negotiation</a> module documentation for further details on its configuration.</p>

	<section id="consumers" class="chapter"><h1>Requirements for consuming applications</h1>
	
	
	<p>
		Applications built for RES must be able to understand the index assembled by Acropolis, as well as the source data it refers to. Practically, it means that they must be able to retrieve and process RDF from remote web servers and interpret at least the “common metadata” vocabularies described in this book which are relevant to the consuming application.
	</p>

	<section id="retrieving-lod" class="section"><h1>Retrieving and processing Linked Open Data</h1>
		
		<p>
			In a perfect world, consuming Linked Open Data is as straightforward as:—
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
					Make a request for the URI you want to get data about, sending an
					<code>Accept</code> HTTP request header containing the MIME types of
					the formats you support in your application.
				</li>
			<li>
					Parse the data in the response using an RDF parser.
				</li>
			<li>
					Examine the parsed data to find triples whose subject is the URI that you
					started with.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			While this process is simple, and could be implemented using virtually any HTTP
			client in common use today, it brings about a few questions. How do you deal with
			redirects? What happens if the server doesn't return the data in the format that
			you asked for? Where do you <em>start</em>?
		</p>
		<p>
			This chapter aims to answer all of these questions so that your RES application
			can be both useful and robust in face of real-world challenges.
		</p>
		
		<section id="consuming-detail" class="section"><h1>Consuming Linked Open Data in detail</h1>
			
			
			<p>
				As part of the RES project, we are developing a <a href="https://bbcarchdev.github.io/liblod/">Linked
				Open Data client library</a>. Although at present this library is currently
				only available to low-level languages such as C and C++, the process
				it follows can be implemented in any language. It is intended to be a liberal
				consumer which can deal with real situations, such as different kinds of
				redirects and content negotiation failing or being disabled by the publisher.
			</p>
			<p>
				The algorithm is as follows (implemented in the LOD library in
				<a href="https://github.com/bbcarchdev/liblod/blob/master/fetch.c"><code class="filename">fetch.c</code></a>):—
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
						Optionally, check if data about the <var>request-URI</var>
						is present in our RDF model: if so, return a reference to it.
					</li>

					</li>
				<li>
						If <var>count</var> is more than our configured
						<var>max-redirects</var> value, skip to step X.
					</li>
				<li>
						Create an HTTP request for <var>request-URI</var>,
						setting the <code>Accept</code> header based upon the data
						formats supported by the application. Note that RES requires
						publishers and applications to support at
						<em>least</em> RDF/XML
						(<code class="constant">application/rdf+xml</code>) and Turtle
						(<code class="constant">text/turtle</code>), but both clients and servers
						may support other formats which can be negotiated.
					</li>
				<li>
						Perform the HTTP request. Note that this should be a single
						request-response pair, and not automatically follow redirects.
					</li>
				<li>
						If a low-level error in performing the request occurred (such as
						the hostname in the URI not being resolveable), return an error
						status indicating that the request could not be performed.
					</li>
				<li>
						Store the canonicalised form of <var>request-URI</var>
						as the <var>base</var>.

		The RES index is made up of a series of <i class="firstterm">composite</i>
		entities which are constructed using the data discovered by the
		crawler. Each of the composite entities has an <code class="literal">owl:sameAs</code>
		relationship with the various source entities used to construct it,
		a portion of whose data is cached in the index.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you dereference the URI for the RES index (currently
		<code class="uri">http://beta.acropolis.org.uk/</code>, but this will change), the
		result is some metadata about the index, including information about
		how to perform different kinds of query, and some selected sample
		entities.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a query is performed against the index (i.e., by adding some query
		parameters to the URI), the result is a small amount of metadata about
		the query and the results along with a list of these composite entities.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you then dereference one of these entities—<i class="firstterm">drilling down</i>
		into it—the document returned will contain both the composite entity, and
		the cached data about the source entities. If the entity references, or is
		referenced by other entities, the relevant composite entities are also

			Linked Open Data in general, and RES in particular, is at its most useful when the data describing things links to other data describing the same thing.
		</p>

		<p>
			In RDF, this is achieved using the <code class="literal">owl:sameAs</code> predicate. This predicate implies a direct equivalence relationship—in effect, it creates a synonym.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can use <code class="literal">owl:sameAs</code> whether or not the alternative identifiers use <code class="literal">http:</code> or <code class="literal">https:</code>, although the usefulness of URIs which aren't resolveable is limited.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, one might wish to specify that our book has an ISBN using the <code class="literal">urn:isbn:</code> URN scheme [<cite><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3187">RFC3187</a></cite>]:
		</p>
	
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>&lt;/books/9781899066100#id&gt; owl:sameAs &lt;urn:isbn:9781899066100&gt; .</code></pre>
	
		<p>
			We can also indicate that the book described by our data refers to the same book at the British Library:
		</p>
	
		<pre class="code turtle"><code>&lt;/books/9781899066100#id&gt; owl:sameAs &lt;<a href="http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/011012558">http://bnb.data.bl.uk/id/resource/011012558</a>&gt; .</code></pre>
				
		<aside class="info">
			<p>
				Take care when using <code class="literal">owl:sameAs</code> to ensure that the subject and the object really are directly equivalent. In particular, make sure that you don’t accidentally state that somebody’s description of something (be it an HTML page or some other serialisation) is the same as the thing being described.

			The data describing digital assets (including RDF representations themselves) must include explicit licensing data in order for it to be indexed by Acropolis and used by RES applications. Additionally, the RDF data must be licensed according to the terms of a supported permissive licence.

		<p>
			In order to express this, you can use the <code class="literal">dct:rights</code> or <code class="literal">dct:licence</code> predicates (at your option). Where the subject is an RDF representation, the object of the statement must be the well-known URI of a supported licence (see below). For other kinds of digital asset, the object of the statement can either be a well-known URI of a supported licence, or a reference to a set of terms described in RDF using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">ODRL 2.0 vocabulary</a>.

			Many kinds of digital asset are not available to the general public but may
			be accessed by the RES audience: students and teachers affiliated with a
			recognised educational institution in the UK. This may be because specific
			exceptions in law allow access when it would not otherwise be possible, or
			because the rights-holder has elected to make the assets available only to
			those in education.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to support this, and ensure that users of RES applications are able to
			use to the greatest range of material that they legitimately have access to,
			the metadata describing those assets which aren’t available to the public but
			are to educational users must describe means by which they are accessed.
		</p>
		<aside class="tip">
			<p>
				A given asset may be available from multiple sources, each with its own
				specific constraints applied to who may access it. For example, a recording
				of a radio programme might be held on behalf of educational users by two
				separate online services, both requiring that the affiliated institution
				be a licensee of the relevant <a href="http://www.era.org.uk">ERA licensing scheme</a>,
				and both operating their own institutional-level subscription schemes. To be most
				useful, the RES index must aggregate the metadata describing <em>both</em>
				means of access, and the metadata must convey sufficient information so as
				to allow applications to decide which, if any, should be presented to the
				end-user.
