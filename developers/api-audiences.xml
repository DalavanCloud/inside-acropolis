  <title>Discover known audience group URIs</title>
  <para>
	The <literal>for</literal> query parameter is used to specify the URI of
	an audience (user) group who is able to access a particular source of
	media which is not available to the general public but is indexed by
	the platform and available to <emphasis>some</emphasis> users. By default,
	queries performed using the API will only take into account media which
	is accessible to all—providing the <literal>for</literal> parameter
	enables <emphasis>additional</emphasis> media to be included.
  </para>
  <para>
	It's important to note that this is not an access-control mechanism:
	users must still authenticate themselves (using whatever means they
	ordinarily would) to the media source in order to view or play it, but
	the query filtering prevents media sources from being shown to users
	who can’t already access them.
  </para>
  <tip>
	<para>
	  Subject to <link xlink:href="https://github.com/bbcarchdev/spindle/issues/47">Spindle issue #47</link>, multiple audience URIs should be specified by
	  repeating the <literal>for</literal> parameter to the query.
	</para>
  </tip>
  <para>
	The Research &amp; Education Space was designed so that applications can
	be generally agnostic to different sources of media, even including
	presenting media which is available to some users but not the developers
	of the application itself!
  </para>
  <para>
	In order to include the correct audience URIs in queries, applications
	must provide a mechanism by which either end-users or administrators can
	select the audience groups that a user is a member of so that the correct
	query parameters can be sent to the API. To enable this, the platform
	provides an “Audiences” dataset which publishes information about the
	known user groups. An application can then use this dataset to populate a
	selection interface.
  </para>
  <para>
	<link xlink:href="#query-capabilities">Discovering</link> the audiences
	dataset is accomplished by retrieving the data describing the API root and
	examining the targets of <literal>rdfs:seeAlso</literal> properties. The
	audiences dataset, if present, will be described in the returned data
	as a <literal>void:Dataset</literal> whose <literal>void:Class</literal>
	is <literal>odrl:Party</literal>.
  </para>
  <note>
	<para>
	  The dataset itself may be <link xlink:href="#pagination">paginated</link>,
	  so applications should take care not to only present the audience
	  groups which appear on the first page of results in selection
	  interfaces.
	</para>
  </note>
  <para>
	Further details about the data which is used to generate the audience
	group index can be found in the <cite><citetitle><link xlink:href="#conditional-access">Conditionally-accessible resources</link></citetitle></cite>
