	<title>Rights and licensing</title>

	<para>
		The Research &amp; Education Space aggregates data which can be
		re-used by a wide range of applications, and much of that data
		describes digital media (such as videos and photographs) which
		are accessible only to certain groups of people.
	</para>

	<para>
		To minimise the risk of data being incorporated into the index which
		applications cannot use, and to ensure an optimum user experience
		when querying for related media, it's crucial that the data that
		collections publish includes accurate rights and licensing
		information.
	</para>

	<para>
		Linked Open Data must be published under the terms of a
		<link xlink:href="#licenses">supported license</link> and include
		explicit licensing data in order for it to be indexed by the
		Research &amp; Education Space and be useable by applications.
		Our approach is aligned with the Open Data Institute’s
		<link xlink:href="http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary">guide to publishing machine-readable rights data</link>.
	</para>

	<para>
		The Research &amp; Education Space crawler understands several common predicates for expressing the well-known URI of the license of a document; see ???data publishers's guide.
	</para>

	<section xml:id="rights-rdf-developers">
	  <title>Tips for application developers</title>

	  <para>
		The Research &amp; Education Space was designed such that
		applications do not have to <emphasis>trust</emphasis> the
		platform regarding data licensing. As the crawler discriminates
		based upon the presence of explicit data licensing statements,
		an application is always able to verify those statements at
		source itself using the same mechanisms employed by the
		crawler.

	<section xml:id="conditional-access">
		<title>Conditionally-accessible resources</title>

		<para>
			Many kinds of resource are not available to the general
			public but may be accessed by the key audience of the Research
			&amp; Education Space: students and teachers affiliated with
			a recognised educational institution in the UK. This may be
			because specific exceptions in law allow access when it would
			not otherwise be possible, or because the rights-holder has
			elected to make the assets available only to those in
			formal education.
		</para>
		<para>
			In order to support this, and ensure that users of RES
			applications are able to use to the greatest range of
			material that they legitimately have access to, the metadata
			describing those assets which aren’t available to the public
			but are to educational users must describe means by which
			they are accessed.
		</para>

		<tip>
			<para>
				A given asset may be available from multiple sources,
				each with its own specific constraints applied to who
				may access it. For example, a recording of a radio
				programme might be held on behalf of educational users by
				two separate online services, both requiring that the
				affiliated institution be a licensee of the relevant
				<link xlink:href="http://www.era.org.uk">ERA licensing scheme</link>,
				and both operating their own institutional-level
				subscription schemes. To be most useful, the index
				must aggregate the metadata describing
				<emphasis>both</emphasis> means of access, and the
				metadata must convey sufficient information so as
				to allow applications to decide which, if any, should be
				presented to the end-user.
			</para>
		</tip>

		<para>
		  Conditional access is described by the following data:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>
			  <para>
			    A URI representing a the group of people who may access the
			    resource, known by the Research &amp; Education Space
			    as an <firstterm>audience URI</firstterm>.
			  </para>
		  </listitem>

		  <listitem>
			  <para>
			    A rights statement, which uses the
			    <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">ODRL vocabulary</link>
			    to grant <emphasis>conditional</emphasis> permission to
			    access the resources the statement is associated with.
			  </para>
		  </listitem>

		  <listitem>
			  <para>
			    A rights predicates associating an actual resource with the rights statement. See ???data publisher's guide for the list of predicates.
			  </para>
		  </listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
		  When this data is processed, the Research &amp; Education Space
		  indexes the fact that the resource is conditionally-accessible
		  and the URI assigned to the group of people who have permission
		  to access it.
		</para>

		<tip>
		  <para>
			Where multiple publishers participate in a scheme using
			a common authentication mechanism to grant access to the
			same set of users, they should agree to use the same
			audience URI to identify those users.
		  </para>
		</tip>

		<para>
		  Applications can then use this URI when performing queries in
		  order to include restricted resources in the results.
		</para>

	    <para>
		    In the example above, the two <literal>po:Episode</literal>
		    entities state that they have an embeddable media player
		    using the <literal>mrss:player</literal> predicate. The data
		    describing the two player URIs indicates that specific
		    licensing terms apply to them, identified by the URI
		    <uri>http://shakespeare.acropolis.org.uk/terms#id</uri>, which
		    is an <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/ODRL21#term-Policy">ODRL Policy</link>.
	    </para>

	    <para>
		    The policy statement includes a permission (identified as
		    <uri>http://shakespeare.acropolis.org.uk/terms#play</uri>,
		    although the Research &amp; Education Space does not require
		    an explicit URI to be assigned to each individual permission),
		    which states that the action <literal><link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/ODRL21#term-play">odrl:play</link></literal>
		    may be performed by members of the group
		    <uri>http://shakespeare.acropolis.org.uk/#members</uri>.
	    </para>

	    <para>
		    When this data is processed by the Research &amp; Education
		    Space, the platform indexes the fact that these players are
		    associated with their respective creative works, and that
		    they are accessible only be members of the audience group
		    which has the URI
		    <uri>http://shakespeare.acropolis.org.uk/#members</uri>.

	  <section xml:id="conditional-access-developers">

	    <para>
		    By default, the Research &amp; Education Space API will not
		    include conditionally-accessible resources in results of
		    queries. This means that when querying for concepts which
		    have associated media, the default behaviour is to return
		    those concepts whose associated media appears to be available
		    to all.
	    </para>

	    <para>
		    In order to include conditionally-accessible resources in
		    the results, an application must explicitly include the
		    <literal>for</literal> parameter in <link xlink:href="#operations">its queries</link>,
		    which specifies the URI of an audience group to include.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Applications should provide a mechanism for the user
	      or administrator to specify which audience groups users
	      are part of. Note that this doesn't grant or deny access
	      to the resources themselves—that's the responsibility of
	      the publisher of those resources—but is instead a mechanism
	      for applications to hide from view those resources which are
	      not accessible to the end-user.
	    </para>

	    <para>
		    Information about the audience groups known to the
		    platform can be retrieved from the
		    <link xlink:href="#audience-groups"><literal>/audiences</literal></link>
		    dataset. By periodically retrieving this dataset, applications
		    can populate a list of audience groups for users or
		    administrators to choose from.
