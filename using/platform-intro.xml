	<title>Introduction</title>
	
	<para>
	  The Research &amp; Education Space platform indexes linked open data, and
	  presents its API in the same fashion. This part of the book is intended
	  for both collection-holders seeking guidance on how to most effectively
	  publish their data so that it can be indexed by the platform, and for
	  software developers wanting to know how to interact with it.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Although some chapters are more applicable to some audiences than others
	  (for example, it isn’t necessary for collection-holders to have a deep
	  understanding of the available API operations), we do recommend that
	  both collection-holders and application developers read this part of
	  the book in full to best understand how to get the most out of the
	  platform.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		At the core of the platform is the <firstterm>Resarch &amp; Education Space index</firstterm>.
		This index is available as <link xlink:href="http://acropolis.org.uk/">web pages</link>
		(to make it easier for application developers to see what’s there and
		how it works), but is primarily published as Linked Open Data in various
		machine-readable RDF serialisations. Accessing the index via HTTP 
		<literal>GET</literal> requests and using Content Negotiation to ask for
		machine-readable data is how you use the Research &amp; Education Space
		API.
